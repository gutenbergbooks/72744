<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
TOM LLANYARD.
</h3>

<p>
'Is it it love itself,' asks a writer, 'or the
lover that a young girl thinks most
of, when she becomes conscious of this dual
existence in her heart?  I am inclined to
think it is the former.  The novelty of her
own sensations occupies her more than the
person to whom she owes their birth and
existence.'
</p>

<p>
It may be thus with some, but it was not
so with Alison Cheyne, for she thought of
Bevil&mdash;Bevil Goring only&mdash;as the embodiment
of her love and of all she could love.
</p>

<p>
All idea of going to Madeira had been
abandoned, and Cadbury suggested that, after
cruising a little in the Channel, they should
land in France and visit Paris, Brussels, or
some other place, when the change of scene
might cause some favourable change in
Alison's mind; and when&mdash;he was not without
the secret and evil hope of contriving to
lose or drop Sir Ranald by the way!
</p>

<p>
Thus, next morning saw the <i>Firefly</i> still
hugging the coast of France, and in sight of
the Hôtel de Ville of Boulogne, and the hill
to the westward thereof, surmounted by the
stately column of Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
Attended by pretty Daisy Prune, who
could not make out the situation in any
way, so far as her mistress was concerned
(and who was the object of much nautical
admiration among the yachtsmen forward),
Alison came on deck attired in her warm
sealskin jacket, with her little hands deep
in her muff, and a thick veil tied tightly
over her face, and Tom Llanyard hastened
aft to give her his hand to a comfortable
seat, to place a hassock under her feet, and
wrap a couple of railway rugs around her&mdash;all
of which he did deftly and ere Lord
Cadbury could reach her.
</p>

<p>
Cadbury and her father were below in
the cabin writing letters to be posted on
shore; thus, for a time, Alison was left to
her own reflections.
</p>

<p>
Now Tom Llanyard was not unused, we
have said, to having ladies on board the
<i>Firefly</i>; but he knew not what to make of
Alison, she was every way, in tone and
aspect, so unlike the much be-rouged fair
ones with golden locks with whom Cadbury
had more than once sought seclusion on the
world of waters, or amid the pretty
seaports of the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
The rich hue of her abundant hair, the
pensive sadness of her sweet face, and the
extreme gentleness of her voice, all attracted
the honest seaman greatly towards her;
and she had little hands and feet that a
sculptor might rave about.  Her grey-blue,
soft, and velvety eyes were gazing dreamily
and listlessly at the outlines of the French
cliffs with that unseeing expression peculiar
to those whose minds are preoccupied.
</p>

<p>
'What can she be thinking about?'
surmised Tom, as he drew near, with his
hands thrust deep into the pockets of his
short blue pea-jacket.  'A primrose on the
river's brink will be a good deal to her, no
doubt; as a writer has it, "she would
romance about it, and poetise about it, and
weave all sorts of fantastic stories about it
to herself, and it would be a very wonderful
primrose indeed before she had done
with it."'
</p>

<p>
So thought Tom while watching her, but
Alison had one idea in her mind&mdash;Bevil
Goring, and how he would be construing
her sudden disappearance.
</p>

<p>
The monotonous wash of the waves
through which the yacht was running, the
hum of the wind through the rigging
overhead, and the measured pattering of the
reef points on the canvas as the vessel
rolled a little, lulled her.  That strange sense
of a double existence which comes over us
at times&mdash;especially in those of excitement
or sorrow&mdash;was with her now, and she
seemed to hear the voice of Bevil and be
with him again under the shadow of the
great beech-trees, where perhaps at that
moment he was watching and waiting for
her in wonder at her non-appearance, and
where so often amid all their love talk he
had paid her what a novelist calls 'the best
compliment man can pay woman&mdash;that of
addressing her as a rational being.'
</p>

<p>
If they never met again, how should she
be able to live through all the years of her
life without him?  Might it not be that in
separation Bevil might cease to love her&mdash;might
only remember her father's insulting
conduct to him at Chilcote, and in time
learn to love some one else, so that if again
they met it could only be as strangers?
</p>

<p>
Strangers!  Then, at the ideas her busy
mind conjured up, tears began to ooze
slowly from her eyes under the concealment
of her veil.
</p>

<p>
She thought often of the hound she had
seen, or imagined she had seen, on that
eventful night; the memory of it haunted
her painfully; and doubtless she would now
have dismissed it from her mind as an optical
delusion, but for its appearance being so
strangely corroborated by Archie stating
that the baying of one in the garden had
awakened her father.
</p>

<p>
In her heart at times fear and pity for
the latter struggled with passionate
resentment at Lord Cadbury as a schemer who
had separated her from her lover.  Her
father's worldliness was, perhaps, far more
a matter of habit and education than nature.
He was, however, now like most men of
rank&mdash;Scottish men of rank, more than any
in Europe&mdash;selfish to the heart's core; sorry
we are to write it, but the history of the
past has too often proved this to be the case.
</p>

<p>
'That is the old castle of Boulogne, Miss
Cheyne,' said Tom Llanyard, drawing near
her, and finding it impossible not to say
something; 'and now we can make out the
arched gateways in the ramparts.'
</p>

<p>
'I have been there,' replied Alison, 'and
know the place well&mdash;the Hôtel de Ville,
the Palais de Justice, and all the pretty
promenades.'
</p>

<p>
Indeed, she knew the place rather too
well, as her father had been compelled to
retire there more than once, from motives
of prudence and economy.
</p>

<p>
'Where are we sailing to?' she asked,
after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'I scarcely know, Miss Cheyne; Lord
Cadbury's orders are that we are to hug the
coast of France and keep under easy sail.
I thought, perhaps, you might know,' he
added.
</p>

<p>
'No, I know nothing,' she answered,
wearily.
</p>

<p>
'Surely it can't be that this mere girl is
about to chuck herself away on a brute like
Cadbury!' thought Tom, as he looked with
sympathy on her blanched face and quivering lip.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you&mdash;you are very kind to me,'
said Alison, as he readjusted the rugs and
wraps about her.
</p>

<p>
'Kind to you!' ejaculated Tom&mdash;'who
on earth or sea either would not be kind to
you!'
</p>

<p>
Alison smiled at his blunt energy, and
she rather clung to the society of this good,
cheery, honest fellow, and felt, when with
or near him, a sense of protection.
</p>

<p>
'It is evident that Cadbury is up to some
game,' thought Tom; 'but it is the way of
the world&mdash;the world in which these people
live.  Her youth and beauty, poor girl, will
be his; his rank and money, the old bloater,
will be hers&mdash;so the odds are evens, and
they are quits.'
</p>

<p>
In the vexation this reflection gave him
Tom took off his naval cap and passed a
hand over his forehead.  As he did so,
Alison for the first time remarked that a
deep red scar traversed it from the right
temple to the left eyebrow.
</p>

<p>
'You must at some time have met with a
terrible accident, Captain Llanyard,' said
she, sympathetically; 'what a pity that wound
is in your forehead!'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, Miss Cheyne, for the interest
it gives me in your eyes.  I was in the
Queen's service when I got that wound, and
nearly lost the number of my mess thereby.
Shall I tell you about it?'
</p>

<p>
'If you please.'
</p>

<p>
'Eight years ago I was serving with the
China squadron, and, having been left sick
at Canton, took a passage in the steamer
<i>Kent</i> to join my ship, which was lying off
Macao.  She had a great many male
passengers on board&mdash;all narrow-eyed, greedy,
and ferocious-looking Chinese.  They were
about thirty in number, and we had barely
cleared the Tigris and made a good offing
when I discovered, by my knowledge of
the lingo, that every one of them was a
pirate, and that the whole gang had taken
their passage together with the intention of
seizing the ship and cargo, after killing every
other soul on board.
</p>

<p>
'Strange to say, as if they had some
mysterious prevision of what was about to
ensue, a shoal of sharks followed us from
the mouth of the Tigris.
</p>

<p>
'I had barely informed the captain of
what I had discovered when we heard a row
forward in the forecastle, where they got
up a sham disturbance, and all suddenly
appeared with arms&mdash;swords, pistols, and
knives, which they had secreted under their
clothes.  The mate went forward to quell
the noise, but was instantly cut down.
</p>

<p>
'No one on board had any weapons but
myself and the captain.  We had both
revolvers, and I had my sword; but what
could we do among so many?  The crew
betook themselves to handspikes and boat-hooks,
and a close conflict ensued, in which
the captain and many shared the fate of the
mate; the scene became horrible, and the
deck was covered with blood.
</p>

<p>
'Fighting only to protract life, and not
with the hope of escaping death, I made
a terrible resistance.  The six chambers of
my revolver disposed of six of the gang;
with my sword I cut down two more, when
it broke off at the hilt.  I was helpless
then, got this cut across my head, and was
forced to leap overboard, where, all but
blinded by my own blood, I clung to the
fore chains, oblivious of the sharks that
were gliding stealthily about, while the
yells, shouts, and explosion of fire-arms
continued on deck until all the crew were
disposed of, save a few who contrived to
secrete themselves below.
</p>

<p>
'Then the ship was ransacked from stem
to stern; twelve thousand dollars in notes
of the Hong Kong banks were taken from
repositories of the purser; a hundred cases
of rich silk and all the most valuable things
that could be found were brought on deck;
the boats were hoisted out, and in them,
laden with plunder, the pirates departed for
the shore, leaving the <i>Kent</i> floating like a
log on the water, with the blood trickling
from her scuppers into the moonlighted sea.
</p>

<p>
'I managed to scramble on board, and
never shall I forget the sight her decks
presented, for the bodies of the dead were
hacked and mutilated beyond all recognition.
I bound up my wound, when almost
fainting with exhaustion and loss of blood.
A gunboat bound for Macao overhauled us
next day, and with her I rejoined my ship;
but the damage done to my figure-head will
never pass away, and times there are when
it causes me to feel giddy and strange even
still.'
</p>

<p>
Finding that he had procured a listener,
though a rather appalled one, Tom told
her many other anecdotes of the sea; but
they were all of a gloomy and depressing
kind, and had reference to wrecks and rafts
of starving castaways, of pest-stricken ships
found with all their crews dead but one
man, of cannibals and sharks, and much
more to the same purpose, for no other
element is so full of mystery to the
imaginative mind as the world of waters; and so
thought Alison, as the <i>Firefly</i> floated in her
aimless voyage upon it, and she surveyed
around her the vastness of the sea, with
that strange fascination it possesses&mdash;'glorious
with light or dreadful with darkness,
instinct with silent shadow always gliding
over its everlasting motion, it appeals to the
senses as a kind of materialised eternity, a
wondrous world, barren and lonely, whereon
not the giddiest flow of wind that ever
crisped its ripples can match the capriciousness
of its fathomless and mighty heart.'
</p>

<p>
Of that capriciousness, and the perils
incident to those who traverse its trackless
bosom, poor Alison was fated to
have a terrible experience ere the dawn
of the next day shone upon its rolling
waves.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
A DISASTROUS NIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
All day the <i>Firefly</i> had run pretty
swiftly along the coast of France, and
that of Belgium, low, flat, and sandy, was
on her lee, when a pitchy darkness fell
upon the sea.  The sky overhead was
black and starless, and most cheerless
indeed seemed the gloom amid which the
yacht was sailing.
</p>

<p>
Muffled in her warmest wraps, Alison
was lingering on deck, alone, though the
night was rather advanced, and she leant
on, or rather clung to, Tom Llanyard's arm
as she promenaded the now damp and
somewhat slippery deck, walking restlessly to
and fro, like a caged animal, sometimes
muttering to herself&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Oh, if I could but tire myself out&mdash;utterly
out&mdash;that I might get some deep
and dreamless sleep at night!'
</p>

<p>
The deck at that time was far from
comfortable, but she preferred it to the cabin,
with the society of Cadbury, who believed
in what Hawley Smart calls, 'tobacco and
moistened conversation,' and was having a
cigarette and brandy and water with Sir
Ranald.
</p>

<p>
To the eastward some faint lights twinkled
for a time far off and dim in the distance,
with black wave-tops rising opaquely
between, indicating the whereabouts of some
Flemish village; but even these melted out,
and the darkness seemed to become deeper
still.
</p>

<p>
To Alison's eye it was a positive relief to
watch from time to time the light of the
binnacle-lamp as it streamed on the
weather-beaten visage of the man at the wheel,
his figure swaying steadily with the motion
of the yacht, and his feet planted firmly on
a wooden grating; to watch the other light
in the skylight of the warm and cosy cabin,
and the occasional showers of red sparks
that came from the funnel of its fire-place,
and melted out, amid the gloom, to leeward.
</p>

<p>
'And England lies there?' said Alison,
turning her face westward.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Miss Cheyne,' replied Tom, who
was greatly enchanted to have the girl all
to himself, and to feel her little hand
clinging to his arm.  'I should think that
Harwich is well-nigh abeam of us now.'
</p>

<p>
'And how far off may it be?'
</p>

<p>
'Some sixty miles or so&mdash;too far,' he
added, laughing, 'for us to hear the clang
of the Bell Buoy.'
</p>

<p>
'Too far, indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'Are you anxious to return homeward?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes, I hope, I do hope we shall do
so soon,' exclaimed Alison, with a little sob
in her throat.
</p>

<p>
Tom Llanyard heard the sound, and,
kindly patting the hand that lay on his arm,
he said, laughingly, 'There is nothing in this
world like hope, to a sailor especially.  What
does the old song say?'
</p>

<p>
And Tom sung in a low, and not unmusical voice,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Poor Jack saw his bark on the ocean of life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now sink, now the billows o'ertop,<br>
  When despair would present him a bullet or knife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lays hold on the anchor of Hope.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'His chest and his trifles may sink in the wave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fore and aft a loved messmate may drop,<br>
  He may shed a salt tear for the loss of the brave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he leans on the anchor of Hope.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '"Heart of oak," sobs he, bluntly, "your fate I deplore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er a smarter could splice me a rope,<br>
  Still, my lad, we must keep a good look-out afore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And depend on the anchor of Hope."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Ere Alison could say a word of compliment
to Tom on his singing, one of the
watch forward cried out,
</p>

<p>
'Light ahead!'
</p>

<p>
'Where away?' asked Tom.
</p>

<p>
'Right ahead, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'I can't see it.'
</p>

<p>
'Can't help that, sir&mdash;it was there a
moment ago, a point or so on the lee bow.'
</p>

<p>
Another man of the watch asserted the
same thing.  Tom Llanyard got his night-glass,
and swept the obscurity ahead with
it, but in vain.
</p>

<p>
Intensely dark was the night&mdash;intensely
black the sea through which the yacht was
running.  The gurgle and wash of the
billows could be heard at the bows and under
the counter, but nothing was seen of them.
There was no phosphorescent gleam&mdash;no
pale streak of foam to catch the eye or
define the presence of the deep, and the
imaginative mind of Alison felt in its fullest
sense all the mystery of the hidden miles of
water that were around her; while the
keen and ceaseless watch kept by those on
deck impressed her with a curiously mingled
sense of security and danger&mdash;security in
the skill and courage of the crew; danger
in the knowledge that there were shoals and
sands about her, and a sea alive with vessels.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly out of the darkness there came
two wavering flames, then a row of red
round lights, all in a line, as a steamer swept
past, looming huge and dark, with a cloud
of red sparks streaming to leeward from her
unseen funnel, and the commotion her screw
propeller and the pulsing her engines made
in the water passed away with her, and
there seemed to be a deeper darkness all
around the <i>Firefly</i> as she faded into the
obscurity astern.
</p>

<p>
'That was the light you saw?' said Tom
to the look-out man forward.
</p>

<p>
'It was <i>not</i>, sir,' replied the sailor,
confidently, 'for there it is again!'
</p>

<p>
At some undefinable distance a light, like
that of a lantern, flickering, feeble, and
lambent, seemed to dance for a moment on the
waves, and then disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a shout went from stem to stern.
</p>

<p>
'Something right ahead&mdash;something large
and black, Captain Llanyard!' cried the
look-out man.
</p>

<p>
'Hard a-port&mdash;the helm&mdash;hard a-port,'
thundered Llanyard, 'or we'll be slap into
her!'
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury and Sir Ranald now came
rushing on deck, and quitting the arm of
Tom, who had now other work to do, Alison
clung fearfully to her father, whose arm
went instinctively round her.
</p>

<p>
'Lights&mdash;lights alongside&mdash;where is she?&mdash;what
is it, in the name of God?' cried
twenty voices, as a dreadful crash, followed
by the sound of splintering wood, was
heard.
</p>

<p>
'All hands shorten sail!' cried Tom
Llanyard; 'man the fore clew garnets&mdash;stand
by the top-gallant clew-lines&mdash;stand by
the peak and throat halyards&mdash;down with
the jib&mdash;lift tacks and sheets&mdash;let go and
belay&mdash;look to the main gaff, and get out
lights for God's sake!'
</p>

<p>
Tom's rapid orders were skilfully and
speedily obeyed, and in a very few minutes
the sails were reduced and nearly furled,
while the cold night wind swept through the
open rigging, and the <i>Firefly</i> rose and fell
on the long rollers, with a terrible jarring
and rasping sound, as she was evidently foul
of some vessel, but had not suffered apparently,
according to the carpenter's first report
on the state of the pumps.
</p>

<p>
She lay-to with only canvas enough on
her for steering purposes.
</p>

<p>
A great flame now glared upward right
under her bows, as the wavering and streaming
blaze from a flare-tin showed that she
was foul of a great Belgian fishing smack, of
a tonnage equal to her own&mdash;her deck to all
appearance full of men, shrieking and
gesticulating as only Frenchmen or Belgians
gesticulate and shriek, inspired by terror,
their pallid and excited faces, half seen in
light, half hidden in shadow, against the
surrounding blackness, as the red glare from,
the upheld flare-tin fell on them, and on the
head or berthing boards of the lugger,
which bore her name&mdash;<i>Le Chien Noir
d'Ostende</i>&mdash;The Black Hound of Ostend!  The
Black Hound!  Was there a fatality in this?
</p>

<p>
Alison was sick with affright; her father
looked grimly, sternly, and pitifully on; but
my Lord Cadbury's teeth (or what remained
of them) were clattering in his jaws like
castanets.
</p>

<p>
'This is no fault of ours, my lord,' said
Tom, 'we had our top-light, as you see;
these lubbers had none.'
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the red light from the flare-tin
shed one more than usually powerful
glare of radiance on the crowd of appalled
visages that lined the hull and filled the
rigging of the broken and battered lugger,
and then expired, leaving all in the blackness
of night again.
</p>

<p>
Every lantern in the <i>Firefly</i> was now
brought on deck and bent on to ropes, the
boats were cleared away for hoisting out,
fenders were hung over the side, and
life-buoys and belts cut away.  Again came the
crashing, rasping sound, as the hull of the
lugger, which was evidently stove in, swerved
alongside the yacht, across the deck of which
her mainmast fell with a crash, bringing down
the fore-topmast of the former with all its
top hamper, making her for the time also a
helpless wreck.
</p>

<p>
A block swinging at the end of a rope
struck Sir Ranald Cheyne and hurled him
on the deck.  Alison bent over him in
despair and terror indescribable and unutterable,
feeling scarcely able to restrain the
conviction that all this was really happening
to herself.
</p>

<p>
'We are bulged forward, and water is
rising fast below now, my lord,' reported
the carpenter, rushing up to Cadbury, who
seemed paralysed with terror.
</p>

<p>
'Stand by the fall-tackles, and lower
away the boats,' ordered Tom Llanyard,
whose voice could scarcely be heard amid
the hubbub on board the lugger, which was
still alongside.
</p>

<p>
Fully five minutes elapsed before this
was done; one fall-tackle got jammed in
the davit-block, another boat was without
its plug, and, barely had the two boats of
the <i>Firefly</i> touched the water, when, knife
in hand, the terrified crew of the lugger
began to crowd into them.
</p>

<p>
By this time poor Alison had fainted, with
little Daisy Prune crawling close to her side,
and was in blessed unconsciousness of the
awful scene around her presented by so
many men struggling for life, and drowning,
as both vessels began apparently to
settle gradually down into the black and
silent midnight sea.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
THE BALL.
</h3>

<p>
Much about the time of the disaster we
have recorded, some other of our
<i>dramatis personæ</i> were actors amid a very
different scene.
</p>

<p>
A star-lighted but moonless sky overhung
the stately modern mansion of Wilmothurst,
and gloomy indeed would the
long, wintry avenue have looked, but for
the many-coloured lamps that shed a soft
radiance from branch to branch, and from
one gnarled stem to another, lighting the
gravelled way for the fast-rolling carriages
that came in quick succession to the Tuscan
<i>porte-cochère</i>, setting down the shawled and
daintily-shod guests, where a scarlet
carpeting extended from the doorway to the
terrace.
</p>

<p>
The great house was all ablaze with lights
that glowed from every lofty window, and
made the owls wink and blink in the tower
of the village church; while a huge fire in
the arched fireplace of the entrance-hall
sent forth a ruddy glow every time the tall
double doors were unfolded to admit a
guest.
</p>

<p>
Bella Chevenix came fully arrayed for
conquest.  Her dress of sheeny white silk
was cut so as to display fully her beautiful
throat and shoulders, with short sleeves that
left her snowy arms bare.  She wore very
little jewellery; but among the folds of her
skirt were trails of natural flowers, with
their fresh green leaves.  There was a rich
flush on her cheeks, a radiance in her soft
hazel eyes, and undoubtedly the girl looked
surpassingly bright and beautiful; and
among the guests she was glad to see Bevil
Goring, Dalton&mdash;looking <i>distrait</i>, as he
always did now&mdash;and other Aldershot men
whom she knew, and had met at balls,
meets, and garden-parties.
</p>

<p>
As one handsome girl after another came
in, all more or less beautifully attired, bright
with smiles and glittering with jewels,
Goring looked on the groups that gathered
wistfully as one in a dream, thinking where
at that precise time was she who might have
outshone them all&mdash;in his eyes at least.
</p>

<p>
The great dancing-room was some ninety
feet long, and its walls were hung with
many old family portraits, between which
were vacant spaces once occupied by the
Rubens, Titians, Vandycks, and other really
valuable pictures, all of which had been sold
in the lifetime of Jerry's father&mdash;perhaps
before the fatal mortgages had been contracted.
</p>

<p>
In a corridor beyond was the band of the
Wilmothurst Rifle Volunteers to furnish
music for the dancers, who speedily began
to arrange themselves, while the programme
cards were fast filling up.
</p>

<p>
Under the watchful eyes of his mother
and his cousin Emily, Jerry inscribed his
name more than once upon that of Bella
Chevenix, but took care that it should be
for dances further on in the night.
</p>

<p>
Jerry opened the ball with the Countess
of Ashcombe, the 'head lady' of the evening,
after which he went near her no more,
or&mdash;as his mother phrased it&mdash;'neglected
her shamefully for that Chevenix girl,' whose
father stood apart in a corner watching with
fondness and admiration the beauty of Bella,
the grace with which she floated through a
succession of waltzes, and seemed to be
enjoying herself to the full, especially when
she had her first dance with Jerry, who
eventually brought her panting and breathless
to the side of her father, just as the
latter was addressing Lady Wilmot, who
chanced to be near him.
</p>

<p>
'The young fellows of our time, my lady,'
said he, in a fidgety way, feeling the
necessity for saying something, 'were better at
this sort of work than those of the present;
they don't seem equal to dancing, somehow.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand you, Mr. Chevenix,'
said Lady Wilmot, with one of her calm
stares.
</p>

<p>
'I mean that we fogies saw something
like dancing at country balls in our time;
what "Sir Rogers" we danced, cross hands
and down the middle, and all that sort of
thing, before, as now, we became anxious
about draughts and damp linen, and all that
sort of thing, my lady.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Wilmot smiled disdainfully, and found
herself looking as if she failed to comprehend him.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Jerry, uncomfortably, 'Hampshire
people did cling to these fashions,
Mr. Chevenix, and, when they danced, meant it
in no mistake.'
</p>

<p>
Though, in his pre-occupation of mind,
Bevil Goring was far from enjoying himself,
he was too good a dancer not to have
plenty of partners, but there was more than
one pair of lovers there that night who
sought the corridors, the staircase, or the
aisles of the great conservatory, and he
regarded them enviously, as he thought of her
from whom he was as yet so hopelessly,
and, as it seemed, cruelly and absurdly
separated.
</p>

<p>
But, as for the ball, it is chiefly as regards
Jerry's affair that we refer to it.  As a ball
it was undoubtedly a success.  There was a
sprinkling of titled people, a number of the
squirearchy, a large proportion of gentleman
farmers, and blooming dowagers blessed
with broods of pert, pretty, marriageable
daughters, and Jerry had brought a
considerable male contingent from the camp, so
'all went merry as a marriage bell.'
</p>

<p>
As for Bella, she was never without partners,
as those who danced with her once
always came back again.
</p>

<p>
'Jerry has actually introduced Lord
Twesildown to that girl!' said Lady Wilmot
behind her fan to Cousin Emily, who grew
pale with annoyance.  We may mention
that the peer in question took his title from
the highest mountain which overlooks Aldershot.
But after a turn or two they observed
that the pair took a promenade round the room.
</p>

<p>
'Is this your first visit to the district?'
asked Lord Twesildown.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no,' replied Bella, 'I live here.'
</p>

<p>
'Live here, at Wilmothurst!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;at the village.'
</p>

<p>
'How funny!' drawled his lordship, rather
puzzled.  'Oh, Chevenix&mdash;I remember the
name now.'
</p>

<p>
'Lead me to a seat, please,' said Bella,
curtly, on which he conducted her to one
near Lady Wilmot, and retired into a corner.
</p>

<p>
'Tired already, Miss Chevenix?' asked
Lady Wilmot.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no&mdash;I never tire of the waltz when
I have a good partner,' replied Bella.
</p>

<p>
'And Lord Twesildown?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, he can't dance a bit.'
</p>

<p>
'Heavens!&mdash;surely you did not tell him so?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I hinted as much.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Miss Chevenix, what will he think?'
</p>

<p>
'He said he thought he would adapt his
step to mine, but he had no step to adapt.'
</p>

<p>
'But to say this to a man of his position!'
</p>

<p>
The haughty Bella, who resented Lady
Wilmot's tone and expression of eye, only
fanned herself and laughed, as if she thought
an earl's son might be 'snubbed' as well as
that of a yeoman.
</p>

<p>
Her hostess now turned her back on Bella,
and never addressed her again.
</p>

<p>
As Jerry was again drawing near, Lady
Wilmot approached him, and said,
</p>

<p>
'Do you mean to dance with no one but
Miss Chevenix to-night?'
</p>

<p>
'Mother, I have only danced with her
twice as yet, and I have done my duty to
everyone else, so I think I may please
myself now.  Our waltz, I think, Miss
Chevenix,' he added, as his arm went round her,
and they disappeared among the whirling
circles that swept over the polished floor to
the music of the military band.
</p>

<p>
Bella had been&mdash;nay, was still&mdash;a good
deal of a flirt, perhaps in a very innocent
way, but a something now in the expression
of Jerry's eyes, in the tone of his voice,
nay, in the very touch of his hand, startled
her hitherto careless heart from its girlish
unconsciousness and gave it a thrill, 'too
sweet for fever, too timid for joy,' or
developed still further the new sensations to
which it had been awakening.
</p>

<p>
And Jerry, with his arm caressingly
around her and her breath on his cheek,
smiled at himself as he thought of his past
jealousy of Dalton and Mrs. Trelawney&mdash;Dalton,
the good-natured cynic!
</p>

<p>
He had still too much command over
himself, and, though young, was too much a
man of the world to let those around him
read his thoughts with reference to Bella;
but his watchful mother could detect that it
was into Bella's eyes he looked with passion
when near her, that it was Bella he took
in to supper, and with whom he sat in the
conservatory after, where the flashing fountain
played amid the softly veiled light, and
half concealed his utterances by the sound
of its waters.
</p>

<p>
And Jerry was proudly conscious that
Bella's beauty had excited much comment&mdash;envy
among the women, and admiration
among the men.
</p>

<p>
'Miss Chevenix&mdash;introduce me to her,'
had been dinned into his ear half the
night; 'is she rich, an heiress, or what; is
there anything singular about her besides
her beauty, Jerry?'
</p>

<p>
Amid all the gaiety around him Jerry's
heart was a heavy one.  He now felt that
he loved Bella passionately; but the
memory of those mortgages, and the view
that they would inevitably cause
Mr. Chevenix, Bella herself, and all who knew
of their peculiarity and existence to take of
his love and his attentions, fettered his
tongue, and caused him, even when he had
the lovely girl all to himself in the solitude
of the conservatory, to speak dubiously and
enigmatically; thus leading her, in her pride
and hauteur, to fear that he was viewing
her through the medium of his mother and
with her aristocratic eyes; and thus, with all
the love of him in her heart, Bella felt that
heart revolt at the situation and swell a
little with anger.
</p>

<p>
He shrank from uttering the words that
loaded his tongue&mdash;the longed for declaration
his attentions had given Bella an
undoubted right to expect&mdash;and she resented
because she misunderstood the reason of
his not doing so.  She dreaded that he had
taught her to love him, while looking down
upon her position in the world&mdash;at least,
the world in which he and his mother
moved.
</p>

<p>
'Do you know that all our fellows from
the camp, and indeed all my mother's
guests, are quite wild in their admiration of
you!' he said, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'How kind&mdash;how excessively condescending
of them?' exclaimed Bella, sharply,
opening and shutting her fan again and
again.
</p>

<p>
He regarded her with a little perplexity,
and felt his cheek colour.
</p>

<p>
'And Lady Wilmot&mdash;does she share in
that gust of admiration?' she asked, with
an unmistakable curl on her lovely lip.
</p>

<p>
'Bella&mdash;oh, permit me to call you so, as
of old?  What has come to you&mdash;what has
offended you?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing has come to me&mdash;nothing has
offended me; but I should not have come
here to-night, and you have no right to
call me Bella now!'
</p>

<p>
'I beg your pardon&mdash;the name came
naturally to my lips&mdash;we were such good
friends of old.'
</p>

<p>
'Your mother does not view us as such.
<i>Her</i> friendship consists of loftily patronising
me, while looking down upon me and my
father too.  You know this as well as I do,
Captain Wilmot.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry was silent, and thought.
</p>

<p>
'I came here to talk, perhaps of love,
and now, by Jove, it seems we are quarrelling!'
</p>

<p>
His face expressed this and the pain her
words gave him; and Bella, ever a creature
of impulse, felt that she was froward, petulant,
and foolishly irritable; but his mother's
haughty manner had stung her keenly more
than once that night.
</p>

<p>
Jerry sighed and rose from his seat.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me,' said she, in her sweet, low
voice, and with an upward glance of her
light brown eyes that was irresistible; 'I
know that I am very cross with you,
and&mdash;and I don't know why.'
</p>

<p>
'Miss Chevenix&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Call me Bella!' said she, impetuously, as
she bit the feathers of her fan.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Bella, you know not how I am situated
with regard to you!' he began, as he
thought of the mortgages.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I understand it precisely,' said she,
flushing deeply.  'You are very fond of
me, perhaps&mdash;admire me very much, of
course; but it is an affair of proud
relations&mdash;high position in the county on the one
hand, and the granddaughter of the farmer
of Langley Park on the other&mdash;that is it?
So let us drop our acting; you your mock
love-making&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Mock love-making!' he exclaimed,
sorrowfully and reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and I shall drop my flirty way.
And now let us go back to the dancers; I
want papa, and wish to go home.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Bella, you know not&mdash;may never,
never know&mdash;what my mind is struggling
with!' he began, in a low and hurried voice,
and then paused; for it was strange that
jolly Jerry, usually cool, calm, self-reliant
in the tumult of the betting-ring, in the
business transactions of life, in the
hurly-burly of a field-day in the Long Valley,
with a dozen of aides-de-camp all bellowing
contrary orders to him at once, should be
wanting in confidence when alone with
Bella Chevenix; and yet perhaps it was not
strange, when those infernal mortgages,
which made her an heiress and him a half
ruined man, are remembered.
</p>

<p>
Young Twesildown's profound admiration
for Bella&mdash;notwithstanding her snub&mdash;admiration
openly expressed to himself, and
that of more than one other man, had made
Jerry feel uncomfortable and savage&mdash;all
the more that he had begun to assume or
feel a right of proprietary in her that in
itself was very delightful; but it is said that
'a man head over ears in love would feel
jealous of his charmer's uncle, not knowing
him to be such;' and certainly Jerry Wilmot
was in that submerged condition.
</p>

<p>
'With what is your mind struggling?'
asked Bella, with reference to his broken
words.
</p>

<p>
'I know not how to explain.'
</p>

<p>
'You do look troubled, Captain Wilmot.
In your usually merry face one never sees
such an expression as it wears now,' said
she, surveying his features with her sweet
and earnest eyes, full of great and sudden
sympathy.  'What&mdash;amid a scene like this
to-night&mdash;this gay world of yours, rank and
luxury around you&mdash;what mental pain have
you to struggle with?'
</p>

<p>
Jerry felt her slender fingers trembling
in his hand, and he pressed them softly and
caressingly.
</p>

<p>
'You know not all I have endured of
doubt and love too, Bella, since&mdash;since&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Since when?' she asked, impatiently,
but in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'That interview I had with your father.'
</p>

<p>
Her dilated eyes expressed great wonder
at this unexpected reply.
</p>

<p>
'What passed between you?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot tell you&mdash;now at least&mdash;and so
infuse an aspect of selfishness, with
bitterness too, in the sweetness of a moment like
this.'
</p>

<p>
'Jerry!' exclaimed the girl, bewildered
by his manner.
</p>

<p>
His name escaped her lips almost unconsciously,
but the sound of it then again, as
in his boyish days, made every pulse quicken
and his heart to thrill.
</p>

<p>
'Bella, my darling!  I love you.  You
know that I have always loved you, and
never anyone else.' (Though this was not
precisely the case, just then Jerry thought it
was.) 'I have struggled against that love till
I can do so no longer'&mdash;(Why? thought
Bella, with anger growing in her breast)&mdash;'struggled
against it, but it has overpowered
me at last; and though the world I live in
might view the avowal with contempt and
derision, and utterly mistake the spirit in
which I make it, I do love you dearly, Bella,'
he added in a low, beseeching voice.
</p>

<p>
All unknown to himself, this speech in its
phraseology was about the most blundering
he could have addressed to the haughty
Bella Chevenix!
</p>

<p>
Her beautiful eyes were sparkling with
indignation now; her face was blanched and
very pale, for she loved Jerry dearly, though
at that moment only anger and bitterness
were swelling in her breast.  She snatched
her hand from his clasp, and, cresting up her
head, said proudly,
</p>

<p>
'This world of yours shall never know
from me at least that you have condescended
to address me thus.  You deem it
condescension; I an insult!'
</p>

<p>
'An insult, Bella?'
</p>

<p>
'Enough of this: let us rejoin the dancers.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry was utterly bewildered, and led
her from the conservatory, on emerging
from which the first eyes that met them
were those of Lady Wilmot, and they wore
an expression at once cold, inquiring, and
reprehensive, which added to the annoyance
of Bella, who hurriedly, and without a word
of adieu to Jerry, took the arm of her
father.
</p>

<p>
The latter had been enjoying himself after
his own fashion during a protracted visit to
the supper-room, and was by no means yet
prepared to withdraw.
</p>

<p>
She danced with Goring, with Dalton, and
in quick succession with all the men who
again and again pressed round her, and
whose names were on her card, including
even the slighted Lord Twesildown, to whom
several bumpers of champagne had given
fresh courage, while the crushed and
bewildered Jerry watched her from the doorway;
and none who saw her there in all the
radiance of her rare beauty, her eyes
sparkling, her cheeks flushing, her whole face
wreathed with smiles, would have imagined
the turmoil of angry thoughts surging in her
snow-white bosom.
</p>

<p>
On one hand Lady Wilmot was intensely
irritated to see Jerry looking so <i>distrait</i>&mdash;'put
out'&mdash;after his too evident confabulation
in the conservatory with Miss Chevenix,
and on the other she was exasperated to see
the fast and furious love and flirtation
between that young lady and the vapid Lord
Twesildown, as she had views of her own
regarding him and Cousin Emily, so Lady
Wilmot was sorely worried by the general
results of Jerry's birthday ball.
</p>

<p>
At last the guests began to depart, and
Bella's father led her away; Twesildown
shawled her in the hall, and handed her into
their snug family brougham, and she was
driven home through the familiar country
lanes and roads like one in a dream.
</p>

<p>
That Jerry Wilmot, whom, in her secret
heart she actually loved so dearly, should
have insulted her in that supreme moment
of declaring his passion by inference, as she
thought, by broadly hinting of her humbler
origin and the disparity of their position in
society&mdash;a disparity his proud mother had
often made her feel keenly&mdash;stung the
impulsive and naturally warm-hearted girl.
</p>

<p>
She threw off her ball-dress in hot and
angry haste, tossed her few ornaments from
her, and, casting herself upon her bed, wept
bitterly in her sense of disappointment and
humiliation, while the dim, grey hours of
the winter morning stole slowly over the
landscape and the silent village of Wilmothurst.

CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE VISIT.
</h3>

<p>
Bella Chevenix took an early
opportunity of questioning her father,
though apparently in a casual way, as to
the nature of the interview that had taken
place between him and Jerry Wilmot&mdash;the
interview to which the latter had referred
so mysteriously and in broken accents.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chevenix told her all about it, adding,
when he saw how she changed colour, and
seemed deeply moved by his information:
</p>

<p>
'Why do you ask, Bella?'
</p>

<p>
'Because&mdash;I never have secrets from you,
papa&mdash;he referred to his interview in a very
remarkable manner in the conservatory.'
</p>

<p>
'Did he propose to you?'
</p>

<p>
'No, papa,' said Bella, colouring painfully
now; 'but he nearly&mdash;very nearly did so.'
</p>

<p>
'A nice move towards paying off the
mortgages truly!' said Mr. Chevenix, with a
rather contemptuous laugh.
</p>

<p>
'He <i>condescended</i> to express his love for
me,' thought Bella, 'and a proposal would,
of course, have followed; he would seek to
marry me that thereby the encumbrances
might be cleared from his estate!'
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts were very bitter indeed, for
now most anxious doubts of the purity and
honesty of Jerry's intentions were implanted
in her mind; and yet she loved Jerry on
one hand quite as much as she&mdash;honest
girl&mdash;derided and despised the inborn and
constitutional selfishness of his haughty mother,
and all such 'aristocratic snobs,' as she called
them in the angry bitterness of her heart.
But she resolved to show Jerry her indifference,
and treat him as she thought he
deserved to be.
</p>

<p>
'His selfishness apart, it is the old story,'
she muttered, 'the old story of the earthen
pot that sought to swim with those of brass.
In his mind, I suppose, I am the earthenware.'
</p>

<p>
At other times, when her real regard for
Jerry prevailed, she would think&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Oh, that papa would throw these horrid
mortgages in the fire, that I might be poor,
and so test the truth of Jerry's love for me.
How strange that my money and his lands
should keep us apart; but for this involvement,
would he ever have loved me for
myself alone?'
</p>

<p>
If Jerry actually meant all he said, he
was certainly not influenced by his mother,
whose frigid hauteur to Bella was never
concealed; and, if he did mean it, she, Bella
Chevenix, might be mistress of Wilmothurst,
and send Lady Wilmot to vegetate at the
dower house of Langley Park; but to
accept him would be at the price of lowering
herself to the level on which he received her.
</p>

<p>
'No, no,' thought Bella, bitterly, as she
recalled what she deemed Jerry's most
galling speech; 'the derision and contempt of
the world you live in shall never be excited
by hearing my name coupled with yours,
Captain Wilmot.'
</p>

<p>
Hitherto Jerry had paid her great, very
great and marked attention, but until the
night of the ball, and with it that ill-omened
<i>tête-à-tête</i> in the conservatory, he had gone
no farther.
</p>

<p>
Should she pay a ceremonious call with
her father now, or simply send her card to
Lady Wilmot?
</p>

<p>
Bella was sorely perplexed&mdash;pride struggled
with love&mdash;so she went for an afternoon
call after the recent festivity, but
resolved to be guarded; and, while giving
Jerry no opportunity of recurring to the
past, show him how utterly she was indifferent
to him.
</p>

<p>
On riding over to Wilmothurst, she and
her father were received by Lady Wilmot
and 'Cousin Emily' in the drawing-room,
from whence Jerry&mdash;greatly to her relief&mdash;drew
her father and Bevil Goring away to
his own particular sanctum, and she was left
with the two ladies, whose conversation after
the prospects of the weather and events of
the ball were discussed, speedily took a turn
that poor Bella knew was meant for her
edification.
</p>

<p>
'You made quite a conquest of Lord
Twesildown, Miss Chevenix,' said Lady
Wilmot, with one of her company smiles.
</p>

<p>
'And of Jerry too,' added Miss Wilmot.
</p>

<p>
'We are old friends,' said Bella, faintly
smiling.
</p>

<p>
'But Jerry is such a flirt!' exclaimed
Lady Wilmot, remembering the visit to the
conservatory.  'He has been a worry to me
ever since he left Eton, and then I was only
too glad to get him off to his regiment.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'The silly boy fell quite in love with a
little waiting-maid I had.  He regards all
women as puppets, and is never in earnest
about any of them; seven years of him, I
fear, wouldn't prove that Jerry had a
heart.'
</p>

<p>
'Jerry always burns much incense at
some shrine or other,' added Cousin Emily
(at whose shrine he had never burned
any); 'his goddess generally changes with
the season or the locality; and we all know
how in country quarters the most silly things
are developed.'
</p>

<p>
'To make love to the lips that are near
has always been poor silly Jerry's way.  He
is such an incorrigible flirt!'
</p>

<p>
Bella knew quite enough of the world to
know what prompted these remarks, and
many more that followed, together with the
memory of a subtle, soft, and sympathetic
manner towards herself that galled her by
its implication.
</p>

<p>
With all her apparent sweetness of manner,
Cousin Emily was a good hater; so she
hated Bella Chevenix, and felt that if she
could traverse Jerry's too probable love
affair with, or penchant for, that young lady
she would do so; she was too well-bred, or
too careful, to show her hand, and yet she
showed a dexterity almost devilish in
implanting in Bella's mind serious thoughts of
poor Jerry, and of adding to, or confirming,
those which existed there already.
</p>

<p>
There was a slight, yet decided contraction
of Bella's forehead as she listened to
these speeches; a slight twitching, too, of
the lovely lips; but a proud disdain of the
speakers was chiefly what she felt.
</p>

<p>
Lady Wilmot could detect that much of
Bella's natural verve and vivacity were gone;
yet she was compelled, mentally, to admit
that Bella was a splendid-looking girl&mdash;bright,
beautiful, and graceful to a degree&mdash;as
she sat there in her well-fitted riding
habit, than which few costumes are more
becoming to a pretty woman.
</p>

<p>
During a country-house visit of nearly
half an hour she thought she had heard
enough, and more than enough, of Jerry's
fickleness and flirtations, and rose to
withdraw; but a storm of snow rendered
departure impossible just then; her own and her
father's horse had been taken round to the
stable-yard; she had now the dread of being
perhaps some hours in the society of Jerry,
and deeply deplored her weakness in
coming, feeling that she would require some
art to show the indifference she had
resolved to exhibit; thus, when the gentlemen
joined them again, she spoke almost
exclusively to Bevil Goring and Lord
Twesildown, or remained silent, for she was
intensely anxious to be gone.
</p>

<p>
If the usually gay Bella said little generally
in Lady Wilmot's presence, she observed
keenly, and her somewhat shy and
haughty manner to her hostess was to a
certain extent assumed, as the result of her
secret resentment of the mode in which that
dame was disposed to view and treat her.
</p>

<p>
'Cousin Emily' had been more than
once painfully conscious that when 'the
agent's daughter' was present she was
relegated completely to the background, and
that even Jerry cared not to flirt or make
fun with her, so much was he absorbed in
Bella Chevenix; and, though in some
respects rather a nice girl, she began to
conceive, as we have said, an animosity against
her, and to consider how she could bring
about a rupture between them before Jerry's
leave of absence expired.  'We do not,'
says a writer, 'resort to such clumsy
expedients as daggers and poisoned bowls in the
nineteenth century; but vindictive people
deal out as cruel reprisals, even now-a-days,
in good society, though it is etiquette to
receive the fatal thrust with an easy smile,
and wrestle with your anguish in the silence
of your chamber.'
</p>

<p>
But to Emily's great surprise she found
that Jerry and Miss Chevenix scarcely
addressed each other; that there was a
complete change in their bearing; that the
latter chatted gaily with Goring and others,
and seemed at times utterly oblivious of
Jerry's presence.
</p>

<p>
She was much exercised in her mind by
this discovery.  What did it import?
</p>

<p>
Jerry seemed reserved and <i>distrait</i>, while
at times Miss Chevenix seemed gayer than
ever, and when she was in the billiard-room
with him, Goring, and Twesildown, and
ever so many more men, she actually acted
somewhat like a romp, while showing how
many times she could hit running off the
red ball&mdash;'a nice accomplishment for a
young lady!' as Lady Wilmot remarked
when she was told of it after.
</p>

<p>
But all the gentlemen were enchanted
with Bella, and were full of admiration at
the grace and contour of her figure as she
handled her cue with hands of matchless
form and whiteness; and when she did take
her departure it was Twesildown that assisted
her to mount, and adjusted her skirt and
reins, but Jerry remained behind in the
<i>porte-cochère</i>, and simply lifted his hat, while
a heavy load lay on his heart.  Her reception
of his love-making on the one hand,
her wounded pride on the other, and the
knowledge that she was under the keen and
cynical eyes of Lady Wilmot and his cousin,
had combined to make the protracted visit a
most painful one to both.  So two of the
actors in our little drama separated, sore
with each other and bitter in heart&mdash;no
longer <i>en rapport</i>.
</p>

<p>
'I am glad that girl is gone at last,'
remarked his mother.  'She is not fit for
polished society, or to associate with Emily.'
</p>

<p>
'I have heard,' said that young lady,
'that when at Brighton she tried to become
a professional beauty, by having her photo
in every shop-window.'
</p>

<p>
'How wonderfully well you well-bred
women can make those you hate or envy
feel that you look down upon them,' said
Jerry, angrily.
</p>

<p>
'I have no doubt she feels amply compensated
for all that by the flattery and
attention of the gentlemen; she is quite a kind of
garrison beauty,' retorted Emily.
</p>

<p>
'Why are all your remarks on that girl
so dashed with vinegar&mdash;decided Chili?'
asked Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'She gives herself airs far above her
station in life.'
</p>

<p>
'Tush; we are all descended from Adam
and Eve&mdash;a gardener and his wife.'
</p>

<p>
'You will never convince me that there
is not good and bad blood in this world,'
exclaimed Lady Wilmot.
</p>

<p>
'Bravo, mater&mdash;cast the scheme of
creation anew!  What are the odds so long
as we are happy.  But I think the time has
now come when you should know the influence
this young lady's father may have in
our affairs.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry now put before his horrified
mother&mdash;horrified to hear of their necessity&mdash;the
matter of the mortgages, and the full
extent of these, and urged that she should
show Bella some more marked attention,
and less hauteur or supercilious indifference,
and have her more often at the mansion
house, to the guests at which she&mdash;a handsome
girl, full of natural gaiety, and with a
decided turn for charades, <i>tableaux-vivants</i>,
private theatricals, lawn tennis, and games
of all kinds&mdash;would prove invaluable.
</p>

<p>
But Lady Wilmot heard him in silence,
with a knit of her pencilled eyebrows and a
droop in the corners of her handsome mouth.
She could only think of these horrible
mortgages, and the awful humiliation of
half the estate being in the hands of
Mr. Chevenix.
</p>

<p>
'The estate seems to be quite slipping
from me,' said Jerry, after a gloomy pause.
</p>

<p>
'Slipping?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, it is guineas to gooseberries that
the rest will follow Langley Park and so
forth.'
</p>

<p>
'Terrible to think&mdash;not to be thought of
at all!  Why, the estate has been the home
of the Wilmots for four hundred years!'
</p>

<p>
'We can never recover what has been lost.'
</p>

<p>
'Unless you make a wealthy marriage,
Jerry dear&mdash;such as you have every right
to look forward to.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry shrugged his shoulders, and pulled
dreamily at his cigar after flicking the white
ash off it.
</p>

<p>
'Let the mortgaged land go!' he
exclaimed.  'I do not mean to dedicate my
life by clearing that for others, which others
did not clear for me.'
</p>

<p>
'Jerry!'
</p>

<p>
'Remember, mater dear, I have had only
a little, and not all, to do in bringing
matters to this pass with Wilmothurst, and I
decline to act the part of a family martyr.'
</p>

<p>
'What will society say?'
</p>

<p>
'Society be hanged!  I have read in a
book, and I know it to be truth, that
"Society at its best will entertain you if you
amuse it, and will drop you, as a rule, upon
the first suspicion of your wanting a
twenty-pound note.  Society saps your energy,
snaps your finances, and half-a-dozen good
attorneys are fifty times more valuable
acquaintances than half the peerage would be
at present."
</p>

<p>
'Where on earth do you pick up such
detestable opinions, Jerry Wilmot?' exclaimed
his mother, holding up her white hands
in dismay, while she began seriously to
consider where a suitable bride with a long
purse could be found and urged upon his
attention.
</p>

<p>
He meanwhile was chiefly engaged in
remembering how, at the ball, Miss Chevenix
had&mdash;after that rather sensational interview
in the conservatory&mdash;gone off at once into
an incipient flirtation with 'that utter oaf,'
young Twesildown; but where is the woman
who, believing herself to be treated as
Bella thought she had been, would have
thrown away a chance of retaliation and
revenge, when a handsome young man of
rank seemed disposed to devote himself to
her?
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
DOUBTING.
</h3>

<p>
Prior to that affair in the conservatory,
Bella had been to him all that a man
had a right to expect&mdash;that is, a man who
had not definitely declared himself; now
that he had done so, she had thrown him
completely over.
</p>

<p>
'What strong running I might make with
her beyond a doubt, but for those accursed
mortgages!' said Jerry to Bevil Goring, as
they lounged in the smoking-room.  'She
thinks I do not want her for herself, but to
rid me of these, and values my love
accordingly&mdash;despises me, in short,' added Jerry,
bitterly, 'and I am without the means of
undeceiving her.'
</p>

<p>
'He despises me for my humble origin,
and even as much as admitted that his
friends would view a <i>mésalliance</i> with
contempt&mdash;yes, that was the word,' was the
thought of Bella; 'yet his debts and the
mortgages together made his royal highness
stoop to act the lover to me.  Surely, after
the past, I deserved something better than
this!'
</p>

<p>
He knew and she knew that for some
time before their affair had been looked
upon as 'a case;' that men began to make
way for him whenever she was concerned,
and that, in short, they would soon get
talked about if they did not come to terms
or separate; and now the separation had
come to pass in a way neither could have
foreseen.
</p>

<p>
A man like Jerry, who rode to hounds
and at hurdle races, who shot, fished, rowed,
and did everything else with such hearty
good-will, was little likely 'to play the fool
with his little girl,' thought Mr. Chevenix,
from whom Bella had no concealments.  He
could not be base enough, but Mr. Chevenix
knew not what to think, and in the first
transport of his anger, but for her piteous
appeals, would have foreclosed the mortgages,
and perhaps thus have forced Jerry
out of the Queen's service.
</p>

<p>
Any way, she must try not to love him
now; love was over, she thought, and she
would never, never love again.
</p>

<p>
Jerry would no doubt marry some one
else&mdash;especially if money was his object, as
she doubted not it was; and they&mdash;who
were so near being very dear to each
other&mdash;might meet in years to come as mere
acquaintances, if even that!  Her eyes filled
with tears, and she drummed her little foot
passionately on the floor at the visions she
conjured up, and felt how difficult it is to
obliterate or transfer affection at a moment's
notice.
</p>

<p>
One moment she would say to herself
that she never wished to see her lover's face
again, especially if all, or even a half, were
true that his mother and cousin hinted of
his character, and all she suspected of his
selfishness and pride; and the next moment
she did so long to see him once more, and
made herself utterly miserable with the
fear that he might return to Aldershot
without visiting the village again.
</p>

<p>
And so these two, who certainly loved
each other well, and might have done so
fondly and dearly for life, were both
making themselves miserable through a very
natural mistake&mdash;Bella deeming Jerry
selfish and vain, Jerry deeming her views of
him unjust, or that his love was what she
suspected it to be, the outcome of
cold-blooded policy, crushing inborn and absurd
pride of family and position!
</p>

<p>
So Bella's mind was in a whirl of contending
emotions; one time striving to believe
in her lover's good faith, and the next
endorsing the opinion of her good, easy,
and affectionate father: that he had but one
object in view&mdash;those horrible mortgages.
</p>

<p>
It was while the latter views were upper-most
in her angry thoughts that Jerry
Wilmot&mdash;his leave having expired, and he and
Bevil Goring on the eve of their return to
Aldershot camp&mdash;rode over to the village
to pay a farewell call.
</p>

<p>
Bella saw him from the window riding
down the village street and across the green,
and her heart beat wildly as she gave
breathlessly a hurried message to one of
the servants, and then rushed upstairs to
her room.  She heard Jerry inquire for
Mr. Chevenix.  He was from home.  Then
he asked for Miss Chevenix, and was told
that she was at home, but had a headache,
and was unable to receive visitors.
</p>

<p>
Jerry hesitated; he knew well enough
that in society 'a headache,' when ladies
were concerned, meant 'not at home;' and,
leaving a card with P.P.C. pencilled in a
corner thereof, turned his horse's head, and,
quitting the village at a canter, never once
looked back.
</p>

<p>
Thus Bella, by yielding to a momentary
gust of pride and temper, prompted by her
then mood of mind, lost the only opportunity
that might ever occur of having the
cloud that hovered between them dispelled,
and some explanation perhaps made.
</p>

<p>
But 'lovers from time immemorial have
always shown much dexterity in the
mismanagement of their own affairs,' says a
novelist, and thus this pair were no
exception to the general rule.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' he muttered, as his canter increased
to a gallop, 'absence is a curative
process; and absence in Africa will be an
exciting addition thereto.'
</p>

<p>
Bella, as she wept on seeing him disappear,
was not aware of one circumstance
that made Jerry spur his horse viciously.
As he entered the village at one end he had
seen Lord Twesildown riding out of it at
the other, and, not unnaturally, he
connected Bella's 'headache' with that
circumstance; but the young lord's appearance
there was, in reality, the merest chance
contingency in the world.
</p>

<p>
'He was not one bit in love with me,'
thought Bella, when days succeeded each
other in slow and monotonous succession,
and Jerry came no more.  'Well, he has
inflicted a sore blow upon my woman's
vanity.'
</p>

<p>
She became moped and full of ennui;
day followed day in monotonous succession,
and she sat by a window with a novel in
her hand unread, or some piece of feminine
work forgotten, listlessly watching the
leafless and dripping trees, for the season
was dreary, wet, and stormy; the mist
crept up from the adjacent stream and
whitened all the gardens and the village
green; and a cold, a sheeny, a wan
crescent moon came out over Wilmot Woods.
</p>

<p>
'What a life I live just now!' sighed
Bella; 'one might as well be in one's
grave as here at Wilmothurst.'
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
AT ALDERSHOT.
</h3>

<p>
Some weeks had now passed since
Bevil Goring last saw Alison
Cheyne&mdash;weeks that seemed as ages to him!
</p>

<p>
If weeks seem interminable when a pair
of hopeful lovers are thus separated and
can count to a day when they shall meet
again, absence 'making their hearts grow
fonder,' what must they seem to those who
are hopelessly apart and kept in utter
ignorance of each other's movements, thoughts,
and plans!
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Trelawney at Chilcote Grange heard
nothing of her young friend, or of Lord
Cadbury, and though the movements of the
'upper ten' are pretty accurately chronicled
in the society papers, as they are named, no
record was given of those in the yacht,
which Goring attributed to its voyaging in
the Mediterranean; yet he thought it most
singular that it had not been heard of
turning up at Naples, Palermo, Civita Vecchia,
Malta, or elsewhere affected by tourists and
travellers.
</p>

<p>
Had Alison by this time bent to the
circumstances that surrounded her&mdash;bent to
her father's influence, and, in utter
weariness of heart and despair of escape,
accepted Lord Cadbury&mdash;been married to him
perhaps?
</p>

<p>
The public prints would in these days of
watchful and incessant paragraphing have
duly announced such an event; but now to
be destined for foreign service, and for a
protracted and doubtful period, the dangers
of war and climate apart, rendered the
chances of their ever meeting again
extremely problematical.
</p>

<p>
If there is any place in the world where
lasting or temporary care might find an
antidote, it is the great camp at Aldershot,
with its thousands of horse, foot, and
artillery, the incessant parading and marching,
bugling and drumming, and amid the sociality
of a regiment, with its merry mess,
'the perfection of dinner society,' as Lever
calls it; but Bevil Goring shrank from it as
soon as he could, and often preferred the
solitude of his leaky hut&mdash;we say leaky, for
those residences erected by the economical
John Bull admit both wind and rain most
freely through their felt roofs and
red-painted wooden walls.  And therein he
chummed with Jerry, now a changed and
somewhat moody fellow, addicted to heavy
smoking and frequent brandy and sodas.
</p>

<p>
Dalton, too, would seem not to have
made much progress with the gay widow
during their absence at Wilmothurst, and
seemed to have seen but little of her lately.
</p>

<p>
Ere long, unless the regiment departed
betimes, they would have the spring drills
before them; but there was every prospect
of a speedy move, so their comrades
congratulated themselves on the chance of
escaping being perhaps under canvas in the
North Camp, days of toil in the Long
Valley, when the eyes, nose, and ears&mdash;yea,
the pores of the skin, were often filled with
dust&mdash;often being under arms from 9 a.m. till
4.30 p.m., with no other rations than a
mouthful of Aldershot sand.  Even the
prospect of fighting in the dense African
bush was deemed better work than that.
</p>

<p>
One morning after tubbing, and lingering
over coffee and cigars in their patrol
jackets, with O'Farrel in attendance, before
morning parade, the corporal who acted as
regimental postman brought Goring and
Jerry their letters.  There was only one
for the former, but several for the latter,
who regarded them ruefully, and said,
</p>

<p>
'What the devil is the use of opening
them&mdash;they are all to amount of account
rendered&mdash;blue envelopes,' and, after glancing
leisurely at each, he cast it into the
fire.  'I thought so!  That &mdash;&mdash; tailor in
the Strand.  I gave him a remittance two
years ago; should be thankful if he is ever
paid at all.  Account for a bracelet&mdash;got
that in Bond Street for Emily; that vet's
account for my horse; Healy's for boots of
all kinds&mdash;pomades, gloves&mdash;no fellow can
do without them; but then there is the
interest accumulating on these mortgages, and
as I won't pick up much prize money, though
it is the Gold Coast we are bound for, I'll
be up a tree one of these days.  But, hollo,
Bevil, old man, what does your solitary
epistle contain?' he suddenly exclaimed,
when, on glancing at his friend, he saw that
the latter had changed colour, that he
became very pale and then flushed red, while,
as he read over his letter for the third time,
his hands trembled so much that the paper
rustled.
</p>

<p>
Goring then passed one hand across his
forehead as if a little bewildered, and handed
the document to Jerry, saying,
</p>

<p>
'Read for yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'Does it concern Miss Cheyne?' asked Jerry.
</p>

<p>
'Please God it may in time,' was the
curious reply of Goring, as he put a dash of
brandy into his coffee, and then looked over
the shoulder of Jerry to re-peruse his letter
again.
</p>

<p>
It ran thus:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
'Gray's Inn Square.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
'DEAR SIR,
</p>

<p>
'We have the pleasure to inform
you that by the death of your father's
much respected cousin, Bevil Goring, Esq.,
of Chowringee, Calcutta, you have become
his heir to a fortune of considerably above
£20,000 per annum in India stock, bank
shares, Central India and other railway
shares, &amp;c., the items of which we shall send
you fully detailed in a few days.  We shall
take all the necessary measures about proving
the will, and, trusting that we shall be
continued as your legal advisers, we are,
dear sir, yours faithfully,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  'TAYPE, SHAWRPE, AND SCRAWLY,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'<i>Solicitors.</i>'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
More accustomed to wealth, and personally
less interested in the document, Jerry
took in the situation at once.
</p>

<p>
'Whoop!' he exclaimed, as he wrung
Goring's hand.  'Whoop and hurrah!  I
congratulate you, I do, from my heart and soul,
old fellow.  There is not a soul in the
Brigade deserves good fortune more than you
do.  What a trump this old Bevil was to
die just in the nick of time, before the route
came!'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean by that, Jerry?'
</p>

<p>
'You'll be sending in your papers&mdash;cutting
the Rifles now.  A fortune, by Jove&mdash;I
always knew you had expectations, as they
are called.'
</p>

<p>
'Every fellow has; they are often, too
often, bad things to rely upon; and yet how
few&mdash;how very few amongst us can resist
the temptation of doing so in some fashion
or other.  But as for quitting the corps&mdash;with
war rumours in the air too&mdash;by Jove,
that is the last thing I should think of doing.'
</p>

<p>
'Egad!  What a night we'll have of it
at the mess hut to-night&mdash;a jolly deep drink,
and have the band out!'
</p>

<p>
'I wish this fortune&mdash;money or whatever
it is&mdash;had only come a little sooner,' said
Goring, as his thoughts fled at once to the
absent Alison.
</p>

<p>
'Better late than never!'
</p>

<p>
'There sounds the bugle, and now for
every-day life, and a truce to the world of
dreams, if possible!  What a lot I shall be
able to do now for the men of my company&mdash;their
wives and little ones&mdash;for the corps
generally!'
</p>

<p>
'Only take care that the mess don't begin
to look upon you as their factor, and be
seized with a singular desire to possess your
autograph.  I know what that sort of thing
means,' added Jerry, as his mind wandered
to Mr. Chevenix and the mortgages.
</p>

<p>
'The worst of being poor is that one can
never follow one's inclinations for good.'
</p>

<p>
'Or for evil,' added Jerry, cynically.
</p>

<p>
Never in his life before did Bevil Goring
pass so extraordinary a time as in the parade
of that morning.  In the pre-occupation of
his mind he made such a number of mistakes
that the colonel and adjutant&mdash;knowing
that he was one of their most perfect
officers&mdash;were at their wits' end with
surprise; though on parade, as in anything else,
a man may act correctly and acquit himself
by mere force of habit, with Goring, in this
instance, it was not so.
</p>

<p>
It was not the fortune that had so
suddenly accrued to him, nor the amplitude
thereof, which affected him thus; it was only
because the said fortune&mdash;'the filthy lucre,
the root of all evil,' as it is wrongly
stigmatised&mdash;might be, with him, the means of a
great and happy end.
</p>

<p>
It might be the means, ere too late, of
saving Alison Cheyne from a life of misery,
could he only discover her; but where was
she?  In what direction was he to turn his
steps&mdash;for that he would search, he had
resolved, if the corps did not depart, as
seemed too probable, in a short time now.
Amid the routine of the parade these busy
thoughts filled his brain, and in 'telling off'
the battalion, when Dalton called out 'Number
one, Right Company,' Goring responded
with 'No. 20,000, Left Company,' at least
so Jerry Wilmot asserted.
</p>

<p>
All rejoiced in the good fortune of Goring,
for he was a favourite with people generally,
and, as for the members of his battalion of
the Rifle Brigade, he was a 'pet,' with them
all, from the colonel down to the youngest
little bugle boy; they loved him for his good
temper, good heart, and the strict impartiality
with which he discharged his duties to all.
</p>

<p>
In the dawn of fresh hopes and the confidence
which having a well-lined pocket gives,
he found himself at mess, joining heartily in
the laughter his own mistakes created, and
'standing' many rounds of champagne in
response to the congratulations of his brother
officers on all hands.
</p>

<p>
He felt that wealth gave power.
</p>

<p>
'Laws grind the poor, and rich men rule
the law,' says Goldsmith.
</p>

<p>
In wealth he was still inferior to Cadbury,
and the latter was a peer, he&mdash;Bevil
Goring&mdash;was a gentleman by many descents, and
that, he knew, counted much by Sir Ranald
Cheyne.
</p>

<p>
Could he but trace the latter now!
</p>

<p>
'Letters of Readiness' came, and it was
fully announced that the corps was destined
to take part in the war against Ashantee;
but, with all his military ardour, his zeal for
the service and desire to add to the distinction
he had already won in India, Bevil
Goring,&mdash;situated as he was with regard to Alison
Cheyne, with his great chance of losing her
for ever&mdash;was not sorry when he found he
was one of those 'detailed' for the de pot,
and would thus, for a time at least, be left
behind in England, and free to search and
look about him.
</p>

<p>
But before the 'Queen's morning drum'
has announced in Aldershot the morning on
which the regiments march for embarkation&mdash;and
before Bevil Goring discovers the lost
traces of his lost love&mdash;we have the two last
appeals to record of two pairs of lovers,
appeals which had very different sequels
eventually; and the first we shall relate is that of
Jerry Wilmot.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
JERRY'S LAST APPEAL.
</h3>

<p>
'The last time we three shall ride out of
this gate together.  Whenever I do
anything with a conviction that it is for the
last time, I always feel unconsciously a kind
of sadness come over me.  What do you
think, Jerry?'
</p>

<p>
The speaker was Goring, as he, Dalton,
and Jerry Wilmot quitted the North Camp
on horseback and separated&mdash;the two former,
in hunting costume, to have a 'spin'
with the Royal Buckhounds, the latter to
the household at Wilmothurst, to which an
hour or two more brought him by train; and
to the last interview with his mother, one
brief enough&mdash;too brief for Jerry's taste, as
he found Lady Wilmot&mdash;afternoon tea
over&mdash;preparing to pay some carriage visits in
the vicinity.
</p>

<p>
Her French maid, Mademoiselle Florine,
was in the act of dressing her ladyship's
hair, and, as that was a very important
matter, she could barely turn her head to bid
farewell to Jerry, who stood near her looking
irresolute, reproachful, and wistful with
his heart and his eyes full together.
</p>

<p>
Lady Julia Wilmot, whilom a graceful
beauty&mdash;a handsome woman still&mdash;had a
theory that worry of any kind told
unfavourably on the female face, that thought
wrinkled the forehead, puckered the eyes
and mouth, and consequently she never
thought or worried herself about anything,
and therefore was wonderfully young-looking
and smooth-visaged for her years&mdash;being
one of the best preserved women in
England.
</p>

<p>
She had a marquise air of bygone days
about her, as the flattering Mademoiselle
Florine often said, and suggesting to her
mind patches and powdered hair, a long
stomacher, hoop or sacque, and pomander
ball.
</p>

<p>
'Actually going, and to that horrid place,
my poor boy,' she said, without quite
turning her face towards him.  'You should
have gone into the Guards, Jerry, and have
done your soldiering in Pall Mall and at
Windsor.'
</p>

<p>
'The Guards, mother,' exclaimed Jerry,
as he thought of his mortgages.  'Before
I return, if I ever return at all, you may
have to cut down the Wilmot woods, and
put down your carriages and horses.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, and for what?'
</p>

<p>
'To pay Mr. Chevenix his overdue interest.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't talk of him.  I detest his name.
By the way, Twesildown calls there
occasionally, I believe, the result of your
introduction at the ball&mdash;and has given the
girl a huge fox-terrier.'
</p>

<p>
'A fox-terrier.  Curious present for a lady.'
</p>

<p>
'Very suitable in this instance, I should say.'
</p>

<p>
'And now, mother dearest&mdash;good-bye.'
</p>

<p>
Her cold manner and frigid kiss from her
half-turned face, as Florine brushed out her
hair, pained him.  He gave her another
farewell glance, and as he saw her slim figure,
her perfect feet and hands, her placid face
and still magnificent hair, which Mademoiselle
Florine was deftly manipulating, he
felt that all her retention of apparent youth
was due to her utter want of heart; and,
after receiving a somewhat effusive kiss
from Cousin Emily, he thought of betaking
himself to the path that led to the house of
Mr. Chevenix.
</p>

<p>
Albeit, used as he was to his aristocratic
mother's fashionable demeanour and
coldness of heart, Jerry's grew sore at the
general mode and tenor of his farewell
under all the circumstances.  Thus he clung
more fondly to the hope that Bella
Chevenix might be more tender, and send him
away with kindly thoughts of home and Old
England.
</p>

<p>
He passed through the drawing-room,
where his mother and cousin had just had
their afternoon tea.  It was flooded with
sunlight, and the delicate Wedgwood china,
and silver tea equipage, were yet on the
blue velvet gipsy table.  It was a magnificent
apartment; flowers from the conservatory
were in old-fashioned china bowls on
the marble consoles, and in rich majolica
jardinières between the windows; and Jerry
sighed as he gave a farewell glance and
turned away.
</p>

<p>
His mother might be deprived of all that
luxury ere he returned to look upon it
again, if&mdash;as he said before&mdash;he ever
returned at all; for many were doubtless
doomed to leave their bones amid the
primeval forests that overshadowed the
Prah river and the wild jungles of horrible
Coomassie.
</p>

<p>
The somewhat pert Mademoiselle Florine,
who looked as if she had no objection
should the handsome Jerry have kissed her,
began to sob when he withdrew, an emotion
which 'my Lady' at once snubbed by
a calm, steady, and enquiring stare, for she
was a cold, proud woman, who, with all her
remains of undoubted beauty, had outlived
all the memory of her youth, and the genial
impulses of her youth, if she ever had
them.  And she had to the fullest extent
that which a writer curiously styles 'the
intense vulgarity which passes by the name
of high-breeding.'
</p>

<p>
Remembering&mdash;he had never forgotten it&mdash;the
tenor of his last conversation with
Bella Chevenix and the way in which it
ended, it was not without a doubt whether
he could see her if alone, and with a certain
clamorous emotion in his heart, that Jerry
Wilmot&mdash;the usually jolly and unabashed
Jerry&mdash;approached the great red-bricked
square villa that overlooked the village
green, and the walls of which were covered
by masses of Virginia creepers, roses, and
clematis in summer.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Chevenix was out&mdash;had ridden over
to Langley Park,' was the response of the
domestic who received Jerry's card.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, considers it his own property, like
the other places, no doubt,' was the thought
of Jerry, without anger, however.
</p>

<p>
'Miss Chevenix?'
</p>

<p>
'Is at home, sir.'
</p>

<p>
Another moment, and he was face to face
with the smiling and brilliant Bella, who
received him with somewhat of a flutter.  A
hot colour swept through the girl's soft face,
and, retiring as suddenly, left her rather pale.
</p>

<p>
'I hope I don't intrude on you,' said
Jerry, seized with a curious access of
bashfulness.  'I find you sitting, full of thought,
with your head on one side, like a canary.'
</p>

<p>
'Was I?' said she, caressing a great
fox-terrier, with a plated collar&mdash;Twesildown's
present, no doubt, thought Jerry.
</p>

<p>
The latter had called in the hope of having
a solemn leave-taking, if not something
better&mdash;one of those eternal adieux peculiar,
he thought, to heroes and heroines in novels
and plays; thus he was rather bewildered
to find that Bella began to run on in a style
of conversation (adopted to cover her own
nervousness or chagrin) that was 'sparkling;'
thus she chatted away, without waiting
for answers, on subjects culled from the
society papers, fashionable journals, and so
forth, leaving him for a time, as he thought,
'unable to get a word in, even edgeways,'
till he announced to her that 'the battalion
had received its letters of readiness, and
that the route had come.'
</p>

<p>
At these tidings her manner and colour
changed at once, and her voice and eyes
softened, as she said,
</p>

<p>
'And you are really going away?'
</p>

<p>
'At last!'
</p>

<p>
'To Ashanti.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, to Ashanti,' he replied.
</p>

<p>
Each seemed as if afraid to trust themselves
to words of their own.  What he was
doing while he spoke he scarcely knew; but
he was trying to fit on the top of his fingers
in succession a tiny silver thimble picked
from her work-basket, and in every case
without success.
</p>

<p>
The doubts in the mind of each still kept
the cold cloud between them&mdash;she believing
that the love he might speak of again was
prompted by worldly selfishness combating
with family pride: he fearing that she
received his love as inspired by fear of the
mortgages alone.
</p>

<p>
'Surely this is very sudden?' said she,
after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'Oh no, we have expected a move for
some time past&mdash;you will miss me, I
hope?'
</p>

<p>
'We have not seen much of you lately.'
</p>

<p>
'However, I should like to take with me
into my place of exile&mdash;for such I deem
it&mdash;a knowledge, a hope that you did miss
me a little.'
</p>

<p>
Bella was about to reply, what she knew
not, but a choking emotion came into her
white, slender throat.  Jerry saw the
emotion, and gathering courage, said,
</p>

<p>
'Do you remember, Bella, that more than
once I had struggled with the love with
which you had inspired me till I could keep
the secret no longer.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry was still on the wrong tack, and
was again terribly misunderstood.  Bella's
pride and indignation came again to her aid,
and she replied, with a haughty smile,
</p>

<p>
'I am not likely to forget, Captain
Wilmot: women do not forget such speeches,
or when a friend takes up the <i>rôle</i> of a
lover; but, after what you <i>did</i> say, we can
never be the same to each other again.'
</p>

<p>
'What did I say?' he exclaimed, regarding
her earnestly and wistfully.  'I remember
that I made you an honest and straight-forward
avowal of the love that was in my
heart, Bella.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps&mdash;but I only remember the terms
in which you did make it,' replied Bella, in
whose mind the unfortunate and misconstrued
term 'contempt of his world' was
rankling.
</p>

<p>
'Once again, Bella,' said he, with his hand
stretched out towards her, and a great
expression of entreaty in his eyes&mdash;'will you
be my wife&mdash;will you marry me?'
</p>

<p>
'It cannot be,' said she, with a firmness
that was not entirely assumed; 'but let us
part friends.'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing more?' he asked, sadly.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing more,' she replied, in a choking
voice.
</p>

<p>
In her angry pride of heart, one moment
she had gone near to hating him, but she
does not hate him now&mdash;oh, far, far from
it, when looking upon the handsome and
earnest face, as perhaps she may be doing
for the last time, but, so far as her words
go, she is as unyielding as ever.  A little
indignation at her hardness began to gather
in Jerry's heart, and he said, in a light tone
of reproach,
</p>

<p>
'Of course, it is too much to expect an
English girl to give up&mdash;on a sudden, too&mdash;the
comforts of an English home, the prospect
of a season in London and another at
Brighton, to broil with a poor devil on the
Gold Coast, and share a South African
bungalow.'
</p>

<p>
Bella took a peculiar view of this speech,
and believed it was a sudden way of 'shelving
herself,' as she had refused him.  She
knew nothing of the military etiquette and
iron rule that prevented an officer from
quitting in any way after letters of readiness
came, and thought that Jerry might retire
when he pleased, marry and keep his wife
at home.  She gave a little disdainful smile
and remained silent, so Jerry spoke again&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'When I was a big boy in knickerbockers,
and you were a little girl in short frocks,
we used to be like Paul and Virginia in the
Wilmot Woods.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, Paul and Virginia have grown up,
and the young lady has come to her senses.'
</p>

<p>
'If the gentleman has not.'
</p>

<p>
'He has come to his senses too, and has
his eyes very wide open indeed.'
</p>

<p>
'She is referring to those infernal mortgages,'
thought Jerry (which was the case),
'and how shall I ever undeceive her?'
</p>

<p>
'In our boy and girl time you would
have trusted me,' he urged.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps, but I did not know you as I
do now, and the world you live in.'
</p>

<p>
'The past, Bella&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Is past, Captain Wilmot; let us not refer
to it again.  I do not understand you.'
</p>

<p>
'May I&mdash;can I&mdash;dare I explain?' he
began, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not&mdash;there is nothing I wish
explained,' said she, warmly, though tears
were in her eyes, and, as they seemed to be
almost 'sparring now,' Jerry rose to
withdraw, yet lingered, with a heavy, loving,
and angry heart, and said,
</p>

<p>
'To me you are in no way what you were
once, Bella, and what I hoped you might
have been.  When I was last in Wilmothurst
I saw that puppy Twesildown hovering
about; surely you&mdash;you don't encourage him?'
</p>

<p>
This was a blunt and unfortunate speech,
for Bella's brown eyes sparkled as she asked, hotly,
</p>

<p>
'How dare you think, much less ask, if I
would encourage anyone?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know&mdash;pardon me; I scarcely
know what I think or what I say.'
</p>

<p>
'So it seems.'
</p>

<p>
Both were standing now, but apart.  Oh,
how Jerry longed to take her in his arms
and pour his farewell kisses on her lips and
hair and eyes; but this was not to be.
</p>

<p>
'How hard you are with me!' said he,
after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'Have you deserved that I should be otherwise?'
</p>

<p>
'My mother has said&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I am infinitely obliged to Lady Julia
for her opinion of me, of course,' said Bella,
cresting up her beautiful head; 'but what
has she said of me?'
</p>

<p>
'That you are the greatest flirt in Hampshire,
and that, young as you are, you have
flirted with every man that came near you.'
</p>

<p>
'I think you must know more of me than
she does, and may know how much of all
this is true; but she told me the same of
you, and even more, and that she could not
get you off to your regiment soon enough.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked Jerry, with surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Because of a <i>tendresse</i> for her own
maid; and that you have been making love
to every woman and girl since.  But all
this gossip does not concern me, so let the
conversation end.  You came to bid me
good-bye?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Jerry, in a hard tone.
</p>

<p>
'Had you not better bid papa good-bye
too?  I think I heard him come in.'
</p>

<p>
She put her hand upon the bell.
</p>

<p>
'Stay one moment&mdash;stay!' he said, imploringly.
</p>

<p>
She looked down and played nervously
with the silver bangles on her wrists, some
of them the gift of Jerry in happier
moments.
</p>

<p>
'Consider once again,' said he, brokenly;
'think of what my life will be apart from
you.  Will you dream of me when I am gone?'
</p>

<p>
'Why should I dream&mdash;and dreams come unbidden?'
</p>

<p>
'Think of me, then?'
</p>

<p>
'A waste of time surely.  I shall have
much to think of&mdash;papa and my poor people.'
</p>

<p>
'Why do you speak like this to me?' he
said, with a flash of indignation.  'Is it
because each day sees me a poorer and
your father a richer man? or has another
touched your heart?'
</p>

<p>
An angry smile curled her lip at this
question.  She recollected the scene in the
conservatory, and remembered it has been
said that 'a woman never yields an inch,
however innocently and generously, to a
man that he does not suspect her, sooner
or later, of having given way in a similar
manner to some man who has come <i>earlier</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'I listen to all this too late.  I know
your motive.  I thank you for the honour
you condescend to do me, but let the
matter end,' said Bella, while a shuddering
sigh escaped her pale lips, for her
respiration came in little proud gasps and her
heart throbbed painfully&mdash;painfully for the
part that pride inspired, and a doubt of the
purity of Jerry's love, though at the time
loving him dearly herself.  It was every
way a curious situation, and at last Jerry
took up his hat and gloves.
</p>

<p>
'We have been somewhat apart of late,'
said he; 'yet I do not wish&mdash;that&mdash;that we
should part coldly.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh no; why should we?' she asked, in
her sweetest tone.  'I am,' she thought,
'in reality&mdash;but for the encumbrances on
his estate&mdash;nothing more to him than all
the other girls he has talked to, laughed
with, and flirted with, as his cold hard
mother told me.  So let me be on my
guard&mdash;on my guard!'
</p>

<p>
'You will&mdash;most probably&mdash;be married
before I return, if I ever return at all,
which God only can foresee,' he said.
</p>

<p>
'I may never marry,' said Bella, with a
curious ring in her voice.
</p>

<p>
'But you <i>will</i> think of me, Bella, won't
you&mdash;broiling and fighting in far away
Africa&mdash;won't you?  I would not like to
think that you quite forgot me.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor shall I,' said she, making a
super-human effort to repress her tears.
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye.'
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye.'
</p>

<p>
He was gone&mdash;gone, and no kiss was
exchanged between those two&mdash;only a
clinging pressure of the hand, and that was
all!
</p>

<p>
Could it be that, after all, he was no
more to her&mdash;through her misconception
and doubt of him&mdash;than a stick or a stone?
If her assumed calm covered&mdash;as it really
did&mdash;a sore, sore heart, how was he to
know it?
</p>

<p>
With her hands interlaced above her
head, as if to stay the throbbing of her
brain, and her swelling eyes cast upward,
she said, in a husky voice,
</p>

<p>
'If I have erred, oh! may heaven protect
him, and make his life happy in some
other way!'
</p>

<p>
However, she did not say with another.
</p>

<p>
When Jerry was fairly gone, it seemed to
Bella that an unnatural stillness&mdash;a hush
fell over all the house.  She threw open a
window to court the cool atmosphere, for
her temples were hot and quivering; she
could hear the murmur of the stream and
the rustle of the trees, in shadow now, as
the sun had crept round to the back of the
house, and a gloom was falling on the
landscape, even as a gloom was sinking on her
heart; and she began to upbraid herself
with hardness and cruelty, and to feel she
might never know rest again.
</p>

<p>
And Jerry's voice lingered in her ears, as
the expression of his face clung to her
memory, and, in a sudden revulsion of
feeling, she wailed in her heart&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Oh, he is going away, and I have acted
a cruel part to him&mdash;away to face death,
and our parting seems like a farewell of the
dying; and his love for me may be true,
tender, and honest, after all!  If so, what
will he&mdash;what must he think of me?  But
it is over and done with&mdash;over and done
with now!'
</p>

<p>
And she took refuge in floods of bitter,
bitter tears.  When, for good or for evil,
for love and for peace, should she see Jerry
Wilmot again?  Too probably, never more!

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
THE GAME THAT TWO CAN PLAY.
</h3>

<p>
Goring and Dalton had gone to a meet
of the Royal Buckhounds, as we have
stated in the preceding chapter, and the
day's run had been a brilliant one.  The
gathering took place at Salt Hill again, and
there was a large field, comprising the
Master of the Hounds, the usual followers
of the latter, and a vast assemblage of
spectators, on whom the two officers looked
with some interest, as it might be the last
time they might see such a sight
again&mdash;together at least.
</p>

<p>
The hounds ran the deer by Stoke Park
to Farnham village, near which he got hung
up in a wire fence, but broke away to the
left and got shelter in Brocas Wood, but
only for a time.  Driven out by the dogs,
and followed by a vast field, including many
men in pink with faultless tops, and not a
few ladies, he was taken at last in Hedgerley Park.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere thereabout, at the close of
the run, Goring lost sight of Dalton, who,
when leaping his horse over a hedge into a
lane, nearly came in contact with Mrs. Trelawney,
who had also been at the meet, but
by him unseen hitherto.  The animal she
rode reared wildly, but she soothed it, and
Dalton caught it by the bridle.
</p>

<p>
'Pray pardon me,' he exclaimed; 'had I
been a little nearer&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You might have unhorsed me,' said she,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
She looked very bright and handsome in
her riding-habit; the <i>chef-d'œuvre</i> of some
London tailor, it fitted her to perfection,
and, being of a bright blue colour, suited
her brilliant complexion and blond style
of beauty.  A French writer says, 'There is
but one way in which a woman can be
handsome, but a hundred thousand in which
she can be pretty;' and Mrs. Trelawney had
those ways in perfection.
</p>

<p>
Since his last visit Dalton had not seen
her, and many of the speeches she had in
her petulance or pride permitted herself to
say rankled in his memory, exciting anger,
sorrow, and surprise; while she, on her
part, had been thinking that she had gone
quite far enough in the game she was
playing with him&mdash;for that she was playing a
game we shall ere long show&mdash;and had been
anxiously hoping he would come to Chilcote
Grange at least once more ere the departure
of his regiment, of which event she had
heard a rumour, but he never came.
</p>

<p>
There was a little constraint in the manner
of both, but being too natural to act, it soon
passed off.
</p>

<p>
'I was just thinking of you, curious to
say, when you came flying over that hedge,'
said Mrs. Trelawney, with a smile in her
bright, bewitching hazel eyes, while the
dark lashes that fringed their white lids
seemed to flicker.  Oh, those wonderful
hazel eyes! thought Dalton, as he replied.
</p>

<p>
'Well, it is said to be always a good
point in a man's favour when a pretty
woman thinks about him in any way.  And
what were you thinking?'
</p>

<p>
'That I was certain we had not seen the
last of each other&mdash;you remember I said so.'
</p>

<p>
'It is my last day with the hounds.
To-morrow my horses go to Tattersall's.  And
you have done us the honour of following
the field to-day?' he added, as they rode
slowly side by side.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I only came to see them throw off,
and am now riding home.'
</p>

<p>
'A pretty mare that of yours, and takes
her fences like a bird, Goring told me.'
</p>

<p>
'I never engage in these sports that way now.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I am getting too old,' she
replied, with a pretty demure expression.
</p>

<p>
'Old&mdash;is this a joke!'
</p>

<p>
'Besides, I must be careful of myself for
little Nettie's sake.  If aught happened to
me&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You are an expert whip&mdash;here is a
low hedge, and I shall be charmed to give
you a lead.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;no; I would rather not.'
</p>

<p>
How soldierly Tony Dalton looked, she
was thinking, with his bronzed complexion,
thoughtful, dark eyes, his dark shorn hair,
and long moustache a shade darker, his
erect and well-knit figure sitting well down
in his saddle, his hunting-coat soiled and
stained by service and exposure to the weather.
</p>

<p>
'Then you have seen enough of the sport?' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Quite, and am now taking the road homeward.'
</p>

<p>
'Permit me to escort you.'
</p>

<p>
She bowed her assent.  There was no
reason why he should not do so, and an
expression of triumph made her eyes sparkle,
and then she asked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Has Captain Goring utterly failed as yet
to discover a trace of where Miss Cheyne
has sailed to, or rather of where her father
has taken her?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;quite.'
</p>

<p>
'It is very singular&mdash;people don't
disappear in that way now-a-days.  Poor
Goring; he is, I know, so passionately attached
to her, but her father's opposition is so
resolute that I think he should school
himself&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To relinquish her?  oh, no&mdash;we cannot
control our love, Mrs. Trelawney&mdash;can we?'
</p>

<p>
'I think not.'
</p>

<p>
'If we could&mdash;if we could&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What a deal of trouble would be spared
us in this world,' said she, laughing; 'but
Sir Ranald Cheyne is, no doubt, still
unaware that Captain Goring is now a very
rich man, and will, I hear, remain in
England for a little time yet.'
</p>

<p>
'A little time only; the transport awaits
us at Southampton; we are all in
readiness, and the order to march may come
at any hour.  This is the last time we
may see each other,' he said, in a suddenly
somewhat broken voice; 'and perhaps
it is as well, Laura&mdash;I have seen too much
of you&mdash;too much for my own peace.'
</p>

<p>
'Captain Dalton,' said she, looking him
direct in the eyes, 'you have tried to woo
me.  I need not mince words or matters
with you, but I have one question to ask.'
</p>

<p>
'Ask it,' said he, huskily.
</p>

<p>
'Are you at liberty to woo any woman
honestly, honourably?'
</p>

<p>
Dalton grew very pale, but he replied, evasively,
</p>

<p>
'I have loved against my will&mdash;against
my conscience&mdash;though your very name
should have repressed that love.'
</p>

<p>
'My name!'
</p>

<p>
'Your name of Laura.'
</p>

<p>
The name left his lips, as she remarked
it had done before, in an unwilling manner,
as if it were familiar, yet most distasteful.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I knew <i>another</i> Laura, and she&mdash;but let
me not think of her at this moment when I
feel that I love you with a passion that I
have sought in vain to overcome.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?' she asked, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
'Because there are hopeless obstacles
between us.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I</i> have none,' was her somewhat pointed reply.
</p>

<p>
'But I have,' said he, while bead-drops
coursed from his temples; and she regarded
him curiously through her veil, and said,
</p>

<p>
'Then you should never have addressed
me at all in the language of a lover.  I had
good reason to suspect something of this
kind,' she continued, in a tone of severity.
</p>

<p>
'And hence it was that you always spoke
so enigmatically to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'As one who would judge of a man by
his past history rather than by his capacity
for good in the future, and so judged me
harshly.'
</p>

<p>
He stooped from his saddle, and suddenly
kissed her gloved hand.  As he did so she
heard him whisper, as if to himself,
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;my darling&mdash;without
destroying your honour and my own, I can
hope for no nearer caress.  Pardon me,' he
added, aloud.
</p>

<p>
When he raised his head, she saw that
his face was deadly pale; but again the
smile of triumph glittered in her half-closed
hazel eyes as she merely said,
</p>

<p>
'Captain Dalton, you have all the gallantry
of a Spaniard, and seem inclined to
pass the <i>rôle</i> of Platonic affection I accorded
to you; but you must pardon me if I mean
resolutely to live in my past.'
</p>

<p>
'We cannot&mdash;ought not to live for the
dead alone,' said Dalton.
</p>

<p>
'It is said that we bury our dead out of
our sight, and may try to forget them,
otherwise the world would not go on as it does.
We may bury our dead&mdash;true, but memory
remains.'
</p>

<p>
'How she must have loved that fellow
Trelawney,' thought Dalton, with jealousy
and sorrow.
</p>

<p>
'May there not be kindred souls that
often meet too late?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'And you apply this to yourself and me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I always thought that such ideas of kindred
thought and passionate enthusiasm occurred
only in youth, and were the result of
propinquity and daily intercourse.'
</p>

<p>
'How coldly you respond to me!'
</p>

<p>
'After the mysterious <i>obstacle</i> you so
openly referred to, what would you have
me do or say?' she asked, with a certain
hauteur of tone, and then gave one of her
merry little laughs.
</p>

<p>
Dalton could not help thinking that the
alternate hauteur and mirth of the handsome
widow at his grave, solemn, and earnest
love-making were&mdash;to say the least of
them&mdash;exceedingly ill-timed, while her pretty
apparent indifference to the strength of the
passion that filled his soul, especially when
on the eve of his departure to a distant land,
piqued and exasperated him.
</p>

<p>
'Can the woman be a "free-lance,"
though still in society?' he surmised, with
pain in his heart, for, 'free-lance' or not,
he felt that he loved her&mdash;yea, madly&mdash;as
only men at his age often do love a woman.
He knew that she was deemed by some
what they termed rather a 'debatable
widow,' whom the social police in the
vicinity of Aldershot, where she had rather
suddenly appeared&mdash;police who consist of
embittered spinsters, inquisitive matrons with
unmarried daughters, whom her dazzling
beauty eclipsed, were rather addicted to
'tearing to pieces,' a process which
Mrs. Trelawney treated with profound
indifference or disdain.  There was a bold, gay
<i>bonhomie</i> about her that might be no more
than a mere delight in the things of this
life, a pretty playfulness and recklessness of
spirit that passed in a handsome young
matron, and which the 'social police'
resented, adding 'that admiration was food
and drink to her.'  '"Free-lance" or not,'
he thought again; 'to see is to admire,
to know her is to love her; but she laughs
at my passion as if it were that of a
love-sick boy.'
</p>

<p>
'Would to God I had never met you!'
said he, 'for the meeting has ruined a life
that, but for you, if not a happy, was at
least a contented one.'
</p>

<p>
'Ruined <i>your</i> life!' she exclaimed, as if
with surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and I shall cross your path no
more.  Our lives are shaped out for us to
a great extent, and mine was planned out
for me by others.  Oh, by what infernal
fatality have you, too, the name of Laura!'
</p>

<p>
'It was, I suppose, given me by my
godfathers and godmothers.  You seem to be
familiar with it,' she added, with one of her
merriest laughs.
</p>

<p>
Dalton knew that a lover laughed at has
a lost cause; he knew too&mdash;fatally for his
own peace&mdash;that the love he had for weeks
upon weeks past been striving to stifle in
his breast, was a love that he had no right
to offer; but her reception of it stung him
deeply, and in reply to her laughter he
said, gravely and steadily,
</p>

<p>
'Then I am to understand that you have
been amusing yourself with me&mdash;simply
flirting to keep your hand in,
Mrs. Trelawney?' he asked, in a voice that was
intensely low and clear.
</p>

<p>
'Precisely so,' she said, with a nod and
a saucy smile; 'playing the game that
always requires two to play it.'
</p>

<p>
'What game?'
</p>

<p>
'Love-making.'
</p>

<p>
'Cruel&mdash;cruel!  God may forgive you,
but I never will!' he exclaimed, and wheeling
round his horse, galloped furiously away.
</p>

<p>
How astonished Dalton would have been
could he have seen the change that came
over the face and manner of the lady he
had just left so abruptly.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes flashed with joyous triumph,
yet they were full of welling tears; her lip
quivered; her cheeks were deeply flushed;
an agitation beyond her control made her
whole form to vibrate; and as she struck
her gloved hands together she exclaimed, in
a low and fervent voice, with almost a sob
in it, 'At last&mdash;at last I have completely
triumphed&mdash;have ground him to the dust!
At last he loves me, and I have conquered
his cold, proud heart!'
</p>

<p>
Then leaping lightly as a girl from her
horse, on reaching her own gate, she passionately
embraced and kissed little Netty again
and again, greatly to the bewilderment of
the child, who had never seen her mother
so agitated before.
</p>

<p>
That night she despatched a note to the
camp requesting Captain Dalton to visit her
again.
</p>

<p>
All the next day passed, and no answer came.
</p>

<p>
Her excitement became intense; she sent
a messenger to the North Camp to make
inquiries, and he returned with the, to her,
now most startling tidings that the Rifles
had marched that morning for embarkation,
and that her note was lying undelivered
in the empty hut of Captain Dalton, who
had left the lines for Southampton.
</p>

<p>
She had boasted to him laughingly and
with affected pride and bitterness of the
game she had been playing.  She had held
a trump card in her hand, and now it seemed
that she had played and lost it.
</p>

<p>
'I have gone too far, too far, and now
may lose him altogether, and after
all&mdash;after all!' she exclaimed, with genuine
dismay.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
'THE ROUTE!'
</h3>

<p>
It was so; those comfortless wooden
wigwams in the lines of the North Camp,
which had known the Rifles for so many
months, now, in the words of the Book of
Job, knew them no more; and nothing of
the smart but sombre battalion now remained
there save a few soldiers&mdash;recruits whose
training was not complete, or men whose
time of service was nearly expired.
</p>

<p>
The mess had been broken up, its massive
and trophied service of plate packed up and
placed in the charge of Goring, who had
command of the fragment of the battalion
left behind.  The senior captain of a
regiment was never employed on this duty, as,
for obvious reasons, his presence at
headquarters is always desirable.
</p>

<p>
On the eventful morning of their march
from camp the gallant battalion of the
'Prince Consort's Own' scarcely knew
themselves in their new 'Ashanti toggery,' as
they called it, which was furnished from the
stores at Pimlico, and consisted, for each
man, of a grey tweed tunic, resembling a
shooting-jacket, suitable for the climate,
with ample pockets; belt and trousers of
the same material, and rough canvas
leggings; the head-dress, a light grey Indian
helmet, perhaps the first time such a thing
had been worn on British ground.
</p>

<p>
Soldier-like looked the Rifles in their
black belts and their heavy marching order,
with knapsacks, haversacks, great-coats,
canteens, and water-bottles.
</p>

<p>
If there was little of the pomp and
circumstance of war in this costume, by
repetition in numbers and by uniformity in the
mass it did not seem unimposing; and if
splendour was wanting, certainly enthusiasm
was not, and loud and hearty were the
cheers that rang along the Lines from one
street of huts to another, as the grey column,
preceded by the bands of several corps,
began its short march to the railway which
was to convey it to Southampton just as the
red sun of November, the pioneer of winter,
shone out through clouds that had a ragged
and dreary look in a grey and gloomy sky.
</p>

<p>
The moorlands around Aldershot were
odorous with withered bracken, and a stray
heron might have been seen, perhaps, at
Fleet Pond, motionless amid the water as
if sculptured in bronze; in the adjacent
thickets the woodsman was going forth,
armed with axe and bill-hook, his dog close
behind him, heedless of war and its
accompaniments, pausing, perhaps, as he heard in
the distance on the ambient air the crash
of the brass bands that led the Rifles on
the first part of the long route to terrible
Ashanti, or it might be the chorus of hundreds
of manly voices shouting 'Cheer, boys,
cheer,' on the wind of the early morning,
but he was thinking only of the bundles of
faggots on his shoulder, the crackling fire,
the clean-swept hearth, the kettle on the
hob, and the trim little wife that awaited
him at home.
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring was accompanying the battalion
to Southampton to see the last of his
friends, and to 'kill,' as he thought, 'another
day of suspense,' the long and empty days
of waiting with gloomy forebodings.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that a few hours had
wrought a curious change in both Jerry
Wilmot and Tony Dalton, but more especially
in the latter, who from being a grave,
earnest, and pleasant fellow had suddenly
became morose, preoccupied, and even
sullen and most impatient; one thing alone
seemed to gratify him&mdash;the sudden and
speedy departure to the seat of war.
</p>

<p>
'What has come to you, my dear fellow?'
asked Goring more than once; 'you look as
if you were going into a fever.'
</p>

<p>
'I am in a fever of the mind, Goring,'
replied Dalton, 'and I may tell you all
about it before the transport sails.'
</p>

<p>
Among the crowd that assembled to see
the battalion depart were many ladies on
horseback.  There was one under whose
tightly-tied veil the hot tears were falling,
as she saw Jerry march past in the strange
Ashanti uniform at the head of his
company; but Jerry&mdash;his sad thoughts turned
inward&mdash;saw not her, and he had no
prevision that she of whom his heart was so
full at that moment&mdash;Bella Chevenix&mdash;was
so near him.
</p>

<p>
'Time will test his truth,' thought the
girl; 'true love does not die, but the false
only, as it depends upon outward influences.
Yet <i>time</i> may see this regiment return, and
Jerry not with it&mdash;oh, God, if it should
be&mdash;not with it!'
</p>

<p>
And the crash of the brass bands went
on, and the tramp of the steadily marching
column, the flash of accoutrements and
arms, the cheers, the chorusing, the general
hubbub, all portions of a terrible
phantasmagoria, amid which he was taken away
from her.
</p>

<p>
Southampton was reached in due time,
and by sound of bugle the battalion was
'detrained,' to use the term now in use, and
marched to the steam transport which lay in
those busy and stately docks, where of old
the sea had ebbed and flowed upon a silent
and sandy shore, and where, it is difficult
now to believe, Canute the Dane sat in a
chair, and took his part in that well-known
incident by which he rebuked the flattery of
his courtiers.
</p>

<p>
By a hand gangway the grey column defiled
at once on board the ship, whose capacious
womb received it.  The men were
speedily divided into their watches; a guard
was detailed; berths were apportioned;
arms racked; knapsacks hung on pegs or
cleats; bedding inspected; duck shirts and
fatigue trousers served out; and so, for a
time, the officers and sergeants had a busy
time of it; while a thousand mysterious
returns, receipts, and requisitions seemed to
require the signature of the colonel and
everyone else, and these were affixed on the
capstan head, the gunwale, the back of the
nearest soldier, or anything else that might
be improvised as a table.
</p>

<p>
Incessant was the clatter of the donkey-engines
as stores were taken on board, baggage,
shot, shell, gatling-guns, waggons,
provisions, wheel-barrows, shovels, and
pickaxes in bundles.  Night fell, and still
the odious hurly-burly on deck and by the
gaping hatchways went on, to the sound of
many a merry chorus or song at times:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'It's no matter what you do,<br>
  If your heart be only true.<br>
  And his heart was true to his Poll.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Though our soldiers are generally too
young to have wives nowadays, in these
short-service times, a few years ago it was
not so; thus several women of the Rifle
Battalion, some with babies in their arms,
had followed it to Southampton to see the
last of those they might never look upon
again.
</p>

<p>
'Good-bye, my poor Mary,' Goring heard
a young soldier cry, looking wistfully to his
girl-wife, who stood weeping on the quay,
where she held up their baby from time to
time.  'How are you to get back to camp?'
</p>

<p>
'Never mind, Tom darling; I'm here, anyhow.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you any money?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'God help you, darling,' he replied, and
proceeded in a mechanical but hopeless way
to investigate his pockets.
</p>

<p>
'I'll take her back, and all the women of
ours who are here.  Pass the message along,
lads,' cried Bevil Goring, who now gave a
sergeant <i>carte blanche</i> to distribute money
among all for what they required, and
directing them all to meet him at the
railway station next morning.
</p>

<p>
'Three cheers for Captain Goring!' was
now the cry, and many men crowded gratefully
forward to salute him and shake his
hand, while he felt now that he could spend
some of the rupees of Bevil Goring of
Chowringee to good purpose; and sure
enough he met his strange detachment at
the station next morning; and after giving
them a hearty breakfast, including buns and
cans of milk galore for the little ones, he
brought them all into camp, while the
transport was steaming down the waters of the
Solent, and heading for the Channel.

<p>
But in this part of our narrative we are
anticipating certain events which occurred
at Southampton, and which Dalton and
Goring, but more particularly the former,
were destined to have long in their memory.

CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE SECRET OF DALTON'S LIFE.
</h3>

<p>
'I cannot understand the terms on
which you say you and Mrs. Trelawney
have parted,' said Goring, to whom
his most valued friend Dalton had been, as
a sort of relief to his own mind, apparently
making what he called 'a clean breast of it,'
and detailing his relations with the fair
widow of Chilcote Grange.  'You seem to
have made love enough to her&mdash;that I saw
for myself often.  You seemed to have
expressed admiration enough for her, to all
of which she appears to have listened with
patience and pleasure in some instances;
with impatience and petulance in others;
and yet you seem to have wound up with a
kind of quarrel at last!'
</p>

<p>
'She acknowledged that she had only
been amusing herself and befooling me.'
</p>

<p>
'It would also seem by your own account
that amid all the curious love-making you
never made her a direct proposal of marriage.'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'I dared not,' said Dalton, sadly.
</p>

<p>
'You dared not&mdash;and why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because&mdash;because I am a married
man&mdash;there now, the murder is out!'
</p>

<p>
'A married man&mdash;you, Tony Dalton!'
exclaimed Goring, in utter bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
'I, Tony Dalton&mdash;the biggest fool in Her
Majesty's service,' replied that personage,
with a groan.
</p>

<p>
'Does Mrs. Trelawney know of this
state of affairs?' asked Goring, after a long pause.
</p>

<p>
'I have more than once feared as much.'
</p>

<p>
'She hinted to me once that there was
a secret in your life that precluded her
reception of your addresses.  Then it is so?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, that I am a married man,' replied
Dalton, as he threw open his dark green
and silk-braided patrol jacket (which he had
resumed after the march) as if its collar
choked him, tossed his half-finished cigar
into the blazing fire, and drained his glass
only to replenish it again.
</p>

<p>
It was in a hotel at Southampton, not
far from where the transport lay, when they
were having a 'farewell drink' after a
cutlet or so, that Dalton made this astounding
revelation to his friend&mdash;one that seemed
fully to account for many peculiarities which
the latter had remarked in Dalton's intercourse
with Mrs. Trelawney.
</p>

<p>
'Why, in the name of all that is wonderful,
have you concealed this so long?'
</p>

<p>
'An emotion of shame perhaps&mdash;shame
at my own egregious folly tied my tongue.'
</p>

<p>
'But when, where, how did it all come about?'
</p>

<p>
'The most miserable stories are often
told in a few words, and thus told best; and,
Goring, I shall tell you mine,' replied
Dalton.
</p>

<p>
'When I was being educated for the
service&mdash;my parents being dead&mdash;I was
boarded by my uncle Sir John Dalton&mdash;on whose
hands and generosity I was utterly
cast&mdash;with a tutor at Hastings.
</p>

<p>
'My uncle was most generous.  I had
quarterly as much pocket-money&mdash;too
much indeed&mdash;as a young fellow in his early
teens could desire to have; I had a horse
at my command, a pleasure-boat whenever
I liked it, and was a frequent attender at
the theatre; for my tutor was a careless
fellow, fond of amusement too, and did
not look sufficiently after me.
</p>

<p>
'All this was some ten or twelve years
ago.  At the theatre there was a young
girl who figured in the bills as Miss Laura
Dorillion, and who was deemed quite a star.
</p>

<p>
'One story went that she was a lady of
high family, who, in a rage for histrionic
fame, had fled from home, changed her
name, and adopted the stage as a profession;
another story was that she was the
only daughter of a man of rank, whom
dissipation or bad speculations on the turf
had ruined; and rumour added that, when
only twelve years of age, she had played
Juliet to perfection in amateur theatricals at
a fashionable West End School; at fifteen
she was a genius; at seventeen she was cast
as Miss Hardcastle in the "School for
Scandal;" and more than once when I saw her
as Juliet I longed, with all my soul, to be
her Romeo.
</p>

<p>
'Boylike I fell madly in love with her&mdash;in
love as dreamy boys at my then years
are wont to do&mdash;and nightly I haunted the
theatre, often in defiance of my tutor, and
my studies became a farce; in fact they were
utterly neglected, and I had but one
thought&mdash;Laura Dorillion!
</p>

<p>
'How pretty&mdash;how sweetly pretty&mdash;the
name sounded to me, and I was never
weary of repeating it to myself.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Was</i> she pretty, you will ask?  When
made-up for the stage and surrounded by
all its accessories, she looked downright
lovely; but, when watching her going from
her lodgings to morning rehearsal, I was
obliged to confess to myself that my goddess
had rather a large mouth, but fine eyes with
a sleepy or dreamy expression, long lashes
and drooping lids of which she could make
a most seductive use; that in figure she was
tall but not ungraceful, and was neither fully
grown nor developed; but there seemed a
great want of finish about her for one who
was alleged to be the daughter of a noble
family.  This might proceed, I thought,
from the style of her toilette, which
certainly did not come from Swan &amp; Edgar's.
</p>

<p>
'The girl was quite a favourite in Hastings;
she played for, sang for, and subscribed
to many local charities, and had about her
none of that fastness of dress or demeanour
peculiar to so many young girls on the
stage; and so I loved her, or thought I did.
I was but a boy&mdash;it was what the French&mdash;so
happy in their phrases&mdash;call <i>un grand
caprice enflammé par des obstacles</i>&mdash;nothing
more, perhaps; and the obstacles were my
lack of independent means to take her off
the stage; my having no profession; and my
uncle's well known family pride, position,
and general views regarding me, his
brother's only son, and all that sort of thing.
Otherwise, I might have continued "to sigh
like a furnace," and eventually, when I went
elsewhere, forget her; but it was not to be.
</p>

<p>
'I was not a bad-looking fellow, and
always dressed scrupulously well; thus she
was not long in discovering me as I sat
night after night, bouquet in hand, in a
certain pit stall; and she no doubt connected
me with the beautiful bouquets that came
to the stage door nightly, in more than one
instance with little complimentary notes on
pink and perfumed paper inserted therein.
</p>

<p>
'Once she appeared at the wings with
one of these notes in her hand.  She blew
me a kiss from the tips of her fingers, and
placed the missive in her bosom, two little
actions which raised me to the seventh
heaven of ecstacy.  After that Laura
Dorillion sang to me, acted to me, glanced and
smiled at me in a way that completed her
conquest, and, in short, I was a lost Tony
Dalton!
</p>

<p>
'As a pledge of solemn engagement, I
gave her a diamond and opal ring.
</p>

<p>
'In the end I achieved an introduction in
the most matter-of-fact way in the world&mdash;just
as Sir Walter Scott did to his first love&mdash;by
the prosaic offer of my umbrella on a
wet day, and then my dream began to take
a more tangible form in little lunches and
solid presents, in escorting her to and from
the theatre, which became an established
kind of expected duty; in walks on the
Sunday mornings along the towering cliffs that
overhang the sea; along the breezy Marina;
by the Lover's Seat in lonely Fairlight Glen
with its thickly wooded sides and tapestry
of wild flowers; by the Dripping Well, that
an enormous beech-tree overhangs; among
the ruins of the old castle, when "the old,
old tale" was told again&mdash;not of Hastin and
his men, or of Saxons or Normans&mdash;but of
our love for each other, and life became to
me a species of feverish intoxication for
some weeks at least.
</p>

<p>
'Some little points of manner, accent,
pronunciation certainly did at times jar upon
my better taste; and she seemed, for a girl
educated at a West End seminary for young
ladies, rather ignorant of the manners and
customs of that "society" which she affected
in genteel comedy to pourtray upon the
stage; but the former I attributed to
association with her inferiors&mdash;to wit, the
members of the company to which she
belonged.
</p>

<p>
'From what you know of my disposition
and general character, you may guess the
end of all this.'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I do not,' said Goring.
</p>

<p>
'I married her.'
</p>

<p>
'Whew!' whistled Goring; 'in church?'
</p>

<p>
'In church! where she was given away by
the manager.  The "heavy old woman" acted
as mother, two young ladies of the company
were bridesmaids, and when, tremulously,
she subscribed herself in the register Laura
Dorillion, the clerk and the pew-opener
gave their signatures as witnesses.  The
breakfast is but a confused memory.  There
was no rice&mdash;no old slippers; and we are
told that no girl likes to be married without
any of the gay things which make marriage
such a joyous experience&mdash;no gay preparations&mdash;no
pretty wedding in a flower-decked
church&mdash;no presents&mdash;not even a new dress!'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Then came a life of misery and jealousy.
I trembled when other men went near her,
and boiled with exasperation when love was
openly made to her on the stage in the mere
business of the play.  I had seen enough of
that done before with considerable placidity,
but somehow I could not stand it now.
</p>

<p>
'With my last quarter's allowance in my
pocket, and utterly vague ideas of the future
in my mind, I left the house of my tutor and
went to share her humble lodging in a
rather obscure part of Hastings, and soon
the sordid nature of our surroundings began
to impress me most disagreeably, as the
bubble began to burst.
</p>

<p>
'At last there came a night which I was
fated not to forget for a time.
</p>

<p>
'I had brought her home from the theatre,
where she had acquitted herself with singular
skill and sweetness as blind Iolanthe in
"King René's Daughter," and she was in the
act of repeating a portion of her dialogue
with Tristan as we ascended the stair&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another time,<br>
  When I had pined for many tedious days,<br>
  Because my father was detained from home,<br>
  I wept for very gladness when he came!<br>
  Through tears I gave my bursting heart relief,<br>
  And at mine eyes it found a rushing vent."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'In our little sitting-room I found an
elderly man, wearing a battered grey hat girt
by a black band, and clad in shabby-genteel&mdash;nay,
quite threadbare garments&mdash;standing
on the hearthrug, smoking a short clay pipe,
with his coat-tails over his arms, his bleared
and tipsy-looking eyes&mdash;one of which had a
white plaister over it&mdash;regarding the furniture
and details of the apartment critically,
while he took a sip from a pewter mug of
beer, and set it down with a clank.
</p>

<p>
'"Hullo, my girl," he exclaimed; "here
you are at last!  This here is a rum go.  So this
is the young gent as you have gone and
made such a fool of yourself by marrying?"
</p>

<p>
'Laura's heart was beating fast&mdash;so fast
that even respiration seemed to suffocate
her; her face was blanched; her eyes had a
scared expression; and gave me a glance
that seemed full of shame and agony.
</p>

<p>
'"Who is this impertinent scoundrel?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
'"Scoundrel in your teeth again!" he
exclaimed, turning up the cuffs of his coat,
threateningly, and striking his battered hat
firmly on his head; "is this your company
manners, you young cub?" he added, with a
frightful imprecation.
</p>

<p>
'"Who are you, and what do you want
here?" I demanded, looking about for a stick.
</p>

<p>
'"Dabchick is my name!  Jo Dabchick,
clown, Banger's Circus, Surreyside o' the
river, and no mistake; and I have come
here to see my own daughter, Laura Dorillion,
as she calls herself, or must it be
Mrs. Antony Dalton now&mdash;Lady Dalton perhaps
that's to be, when your uncle hops his
blessed twig?"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, father," said Laura, in a breathless
voice, "why have you come, and how did
you find me out?"
</p>

<p>
'"I come because I want money; and, as
for finding you out, that was easy enough;
the Hastings theatre ain't at the bottom of
the sea."
</p>

<p>
"'And mother?"
</p>

<p>
'"Is there in your bed&mdash;has had a drop
too much, and so I have tucked her in there;
and now what have you got for supper&mdash;tripe,
sausages, bloaters, or summat tasty, I
hope?  Speak&mdash;you look as lively as a
couple of glow-worms in the sunshine!"
</p>

<p>
'My soul sickened within me!  And with
these additions to our little household&mdash;a
slatternly, odious mother, a beery,
broken-down actor, whose line had once been
genteel comedy, a clown in a circus latterly, but
whose incessant dissipation had deprived him
of all employment&mdash;life became a burden
now, and my stupendous folly stood in
letters of fire before me.
</p>

<p>
'Existence became unendurable, and neither
Laura nor I dared to look forward to
the dark and vague future we might be
doomed to drag out in the world.
</p>

<p>
'Their arrival filled my wife with shame
and anger, and I do believe with generous
sorrow for me.  My quarter's pittance was
soon expended; <i>her</i> salary could not maintain
us all.  My tutor soon discovered the
whole situation, and laid it mercilessly bare
before my uncle, Sir John Dalton, who from
that hour cast me off, ignored my letters
and my existence, and disinherited me by his
will.
</p>

<p>
'I had no money, or means of getting
any, after the best of my jewellery and
wardrobe had departed.  Laura's father and
mother soon proved abusive and most
obnoxious to me; they insulted me hourly, and
eventually drove me from the squalid lodgings
we shared together.  Laura one night
took their part; it required but that to fill
up the measure of my disgust, and I found
myself wandering in the streets with all I
possessed in the world&mdash;the clothes that I
wore.  I rooted the love of her out of my
heart; but it was long before I could efface
her image, which often a fancied resemblance
in another brought before me.
</p>

<p>
'There are some men of whom it is said
that they will not acknowledge their false
steps even to their own hearts; but I am
not one of them, and must acknowledge,
dear Goring, that in sackcloth and ashes I
have repented of mine.
</p>

<p>
'My haughty uncle proving obdurate to
the last degree, there was no hope for me
so far as he was concerned; so I took the
Queen's shilling and sailed for India, and
there I strove to forget my boyish folly,
the contemptible position I had occupied
with such a father and mother-in-law, the
disgust and horror with which their advent
and their surroundings inspired me&mdash;sick,
too, of the slatternly girl I had married,
for slatternly she too was in her home and
when off the stage, reserving all her toilettes
and her graces for the British public.
</p>

<p>
'You know the rest.  I soon got a
commission through the ranks&mdash;sooner than I
could have got it through the medium of a
crammer and exams.  From the hour I
turned at midnight along the Marina of
Hastings, and heard the monotonous sound
of the surge, as it rolled on the beach in
the dark, I have never heard of my wife or
been able to trace her.  Her odious parents
I discovered have been long since dead, and
that she is no longer on the stage, or, if so,
bears another name, or has gone I know
not where.
</p>

<p>
'I have sometimes hoped that I had been
freed from her by death&mdash;ungenerous
though that hope may be, and that my uncle
must have heard of her demise, when by a
codicil to his will he left me all his fortune.
And now you know why it was that I dared
not make a proposal to Mrs. Trelawney&mdash;nor
did I ever think of love or marriage till
I met her lately; and how I love her, and
have struggled to tear that hopeless passion
from my heart, is known only to God and to
myself!'
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.
</h3>

<p>
'Poor Dalton! you have indeed suffered
deeply&mdash;paid dear for your boyish folly,'
said Goring, as the former concluded
the little story of his early life in a
voice tremulous with emotion.  'Now the
apparent inconsistency of your attention to
Mrs. Trelawney is quite accounted for.'
</p>

<p>
'Until I knew myself free to ask her to
be my wife I had sworn in my inner heart
that I would not do so&mdash;indeed, I dared
not do so; yet, for the life of me, attracted
as I was, I could not help hovering about
her; but now I am going to Ashanti, and
there is an end of it!  Such was the end of
the fatal passion of a foolish lad.  Since
those days I have never entered a theatre,
and shudder at the mere idea of a dramatic
situation.'
</p>

<p>
'You are in one now,' said a sweet and
tremulous voice, as Mrs. Trelawney, who,
unseen and unheard by them in their
preoccupation, had softly entered the room,
stood before them.
</p>

<p>
How much or how little she had overheard
they did not precisely know, but with
a smile of mingled sadness and sweetness,
pride and triumph, she threw up her veil,
and the full light of the gasalier overhead
fell upon her rich, shining hair, her beautiful
and animated countenance.
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Trelawney!' exclaimed the friends
together, as they started from their chairs.
</p>

<p>
'You here&mdash;in Southampton!' added
Dalton, in a voice tremulous with bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  Can it be that you have yet to
learn that I am that Laura Dorillion to
whom you gave this opal and diamond ring,
with whom you spent so many a sweet
hour, by Fairlight Glen, the East Cliffs that
overhang the sea, by the Dripping Well,
and amid the old castle walls at
Hastings&mdash;the Laura whom you married, and from
whom you so coldly fled?'
</p>

<p>
Dalton tried to speak, but his voice was
gone; he could but stretch his hand
towards her, without advancing, while
regarding her with growing bewilderment; so
she spoke again, with tears in her voice.
</p>

<p>
'You ought to have forgiven me the
humility of my origin, for that I could not
help&mdash;ay, forgiven me long ago, Anthony.
Remember that "he who cannot forgive
breaks the bridge over which he must pass
himself," for "every man hath need of
forgiveness," we are told.'
</p>

<p>
'My wife&mdash;you?' exclaimed Dalton.
</p>

<p>
'Laura&mdash;your own wife, whom you married
in St. Clement's Church on the tenth
of August.  You remember the day?'
</p>

<p>
The words were simple, but spoken with
great pathos, and all her sparkling manner
seemed to have left her as she seated
herself, and he hung over her.
</p>

<p>
'Do you forgive me, Laura, and pardon
me&mdash;pardon me, and love me?'
</p>

<p>
'You know that I love you.'
</p>

<p>
He was about to put an arm round her,
when he paused, and said,
</p>

<p>
'But whence this name of Trelawney?'
</p>

<p>
'I assumed it from an aunt, who left me
a small fortune, but for which I&mdash;I might
have been compelled to struggle in penury
on the stage to support your daughter.'
</p>

<p>
'My daughter!' exclaimed Dalton, a
great love for the beautiful little girl lie
knew suddenly gushing up in his heart.
'My daughter&mdash;mine?'
</p>

<p>
'Our child,' said Laura, softly.
</p>

<p>
'Born&mdash;when?'
</p>

<p>
'Six months after you left me at Hastings.'
</p>

<p>
'But her name&mdash;of Antoinette?'
</p>

<p>
'Is but the feminine of your own&mdash;Anthony.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what a blind fool I have been&mdash;Laura&mdash;Laura!'
</p>

<p>
Goring, who had been studying a picture
on the wall, now thought he might as well
withdraw softly, and smoke his cigar outside.
</p>

<p>
Taller in stature, fuller in figure, more
fully developed in every way, and with a
bearing, manner, and grace cultivated by
those among whom she had moved, it
required a certain effort to recognise in her
the girlish Laura Dorillion of the past time.
Though her whole style was different&mdash;finer
and more statuesque&mdash;and the mode of her
toilette and of dressing her hair was different,
her voice and the inflections of it, her
expression of eye, the droop of the lid and
flicker of the long lash, and the sweet smile
of her lip were, he now saw, all unchanged,
and he pressed her to his breast in the
rapture of the moment, forgetting that the
transport which was soon to bear him away
was at that supreme moment of joy having
her fires banked up preparatory to putting
to sea.
</p>

<p>
'And you love me, Laura?' he never
was tired of repeating, and hearing the
sweet admission that she did so.  'Oh, why
have you concealed till this&mdash;why have you
concealed yourself thus, and from me?'
</p>

<p>
'I wished to try you&mdash;to test you&mdash;to
compel you to love me, and I have done
so, have I not?' she asked, taking his face
between her hands and gazing tenderly
into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'You know now what fettered my
tongue,' said he, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
'I knew you were in bondage&mdash;but it
was in bondage to <i>me</i>.  Your love for me
was an insult to myself; your compliments
and intentions in the present time, were an
implied insult to my past.  You dared to
love me, knowing that you had a wife
somewhere&mdash;where, you knew not; but you
little thought that Mrs. Trelawney, the
supposed widow of a mythical Trelawney, and
Laura Dorillion were one and the same
person.  Now, is the situation dramatic?  Do
you remember that you told me that you
loved me against your own will and
conscience, and that my very <i>name</i> of Laura
repressed that love at times?  Heavens,
could you but know what I felt&mdash;how my
heart was wrung&mdash;my woman's pride
alternately roused and crushed by admissions
such as these!  I have suffered greatly,
darling, but all is over now,' she added,
laying her cheek on his breast, while his
lips were pressed to her forehead.
</p>

<p>
After a time, she spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'I knew not that you were in the Army,
or were in life.  I knew not of your existence
till I met you suddenly at Aldershot,
after I had lived years of seclusion in the
Channel Isles.  I thanked God for the
discovery; I vowed to win you again, if I
could, before I would reveal myself&mdash;and I
have done so.'
</p>

<p>
She whose love he had so longed and
prayed for, and yet striven to root out of
his heart, was now his own&mdash;his own after
all; and all the pent-up love of lonely
years had found reward at last.
</p>

<p>
'Often before I met you again&mdash;discovered
you, and vowed to make you
mine again, I had pondered that, but for
Netty's sake, whether, taking it all in all,
the good with the bad, life was worth
living,' said she, her eyes full of tears now.
</p>

<p>
'And till now, Laura, my life has seemed
a gloomy and empty one.  I was often
appalled by the aimlessness and isolation of it.'
</p>

<p>
'How strange it is that you never discovered
me!' said Laura; 'yet I have seen
your eyes wander more than once to this
engagement ring.'
</p>

<p>
'And stranger still that when I heard
you sing the old, old song that was once so
familiar, making my heart thrill with
troubled memories, no light came to me.
Oh, Laura, you acted well your part to
this joyous ending.'
</p>

<p>
'I told you that I had found the verses
in an old album, where a friend wrote them
years ago; that friend was yourself.  You
remember so lately telling me that I had
ruined your life?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Laura, and your cruel smile.'
</p>

<p>
'God knows how at that moment I
longed to cast myself on your breast,
Anthony, as I do now, and barter all my past
wrongs for a single kiss!'
</p>

<p>
His Christian name again on her lips, as in
the days of their boy and girl love, ere the
black change came, and how strange, yet
familiar&mdash;how sweet, how dear it sounded!
</p>

<p>
'How did you learn I was here with
Goring?' he asked, tenderly.
</p>

<p>
'I learned it at the transport.'
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;my darling, why have you
kept all this secret so long&mdash;the secret
that you were my own?'
</p>

<p>
'As I told you, I would never be more
to you <i>than I am now</i>, were I to live a
hundred years, and was I not right?'
</p>

<p>
'But to keep the secret so long&mdash;I might
never have learned it, for to-morrow will
see us separated.  Hastings was the first
volume of our romance.'
</p>

<p>
'Southampton was the second.'
</p>

<p>
'The third is Ashanti.  How it will end,
God alone knows, darling,' he added, straining
her in his embrace, while her tears fell
fast now; 'if spared to return to you,
Laura&mdash;to you and little Netty&mdash;you will never
regret your love and trust in me at last&mdash;your
confidence in my affection.'
</p>

<p>
Poor Dalton&mdash;'if spared;' he was right
to say that, with the fate and fortune of a
barbarous war before him.
</p>

<p>
The old love had become the new one,
and the new love was the old; and yet it
seemed that to-night both had entered on a
new relationship.
</p>

<p>
And, as we have said, the two last
appeals of Jerry Wilmot and Dalton ended
differently.  Practically they came to the
same conclusion&mdash;a separation from those
they loved.
</p>

<p>
Laura now deplored deeply her pride
and folly, as she deemed it, in playing the
game she had done so long; but the separation
had to be faced and endured; yet she
watched the transport, as it steamed down
Southampton water, till it melted into the
haze; and it was not until then that she fully
realised that her husband, so lately restored
to her, was gone again, and perhaps for ever.
</p>

<p>
But that her appearance on board would
have excited speculation in the battalion,
she would have gone down the Channel
with the steamer and come ashore in the
pilot's boat at Deal.
</p>

<p>
On the long, though rapid voyage, Dalton
had ample food for reflection, for thinking
of the strangeness of his fate, that for
months past he had been associating with,
meeting and seeing at intervals, and loving
deeply, a woman who was his own wife,
and yet he knew it not!
</p>

<p>
Why had she played this perilous game
so long?
</p>

<p>
Why, but for the temptation to win him
again, and for the gratification of a kind of
affectionate vengeance.  And now they
were separated, each with but a memory to
the other again.
</p>

<p>
A few photos and two locks of hair&mdash;the
light blond hair of his wife, a golden
curl of his little daughter&mdash;were all that
poor Dalton took with him to the burning
coast of Ashanti, to remind him of the
happiness he had so lately and so briefly
tasted, and might never taste more.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
BEVIL GORING'S RESOLUTION.
</h3>

<p>
In his bitter anxiety Bevil Goring
condescended again to apply to Mr. Solomon
Slagg as to the movements of Lord
Cadbury; but ignorant perhaps of the
peer's actual whereabouts, and that the
applicant was now the possessor of twenty
thousand per annum, he never vouchsafed
the slightest reply.
</p>

<p>
Alison had promised to wait for him a
year&mdash;and well he knew that, if left to
herself, she would have waited for several.
Would she be true to that promise?  Could
he but find her now, he would have no
compunction in carrying her off, whatever
her father might say, though it would seem
that the brave old Scottish days of Lochinvar
and Jock of Hazeldean are over and
for ever.
</p>

<p>
The corps was gone now, and he felt dull
and lonely with the dépôt, which would
probably soon be taken from the camp to
Chatham or elsewhere, and the little duty
he had of it consisted chiefly of drilling
and training green hands, and taking them
through a weary course of musketry, while
his thoughts were elsewhere, and he soon
began to feel that, if he did not soon learn
tidings of Alison, he would 'leave no stone
unturned' to get away from Aldershot&mdash;to
get away to fight the Ashantees or any
other folks; and the next moment he
would be thankful that he was left behind
to search for her.
</p>

<p>
To search for her&mdash;but where?
</p>

<p>
Ay, where?  He was soon to receive a
terrible rouser!
</p>

<p>
One day he visited Mrs. Trelawney to
inform her that the transport with Dalton
and the regiment on board had been spoken
with by a vessel some sixty miles westward
of Ushant, when he found her in the act of
writing a note to himself, and looking
somewhat nervous and disturbed in manner.
</p>

<p>
She received him with unusual kindness,
and with a kind of sympathy in her manner
that puzzled him.
</p>

<p>
After a little pause, while eyeing him
closely, she said,
</p>

<p>
'You have seen this morning's paper, I
presume?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said he, and his heart seemed to
flutter, as it was evident that she had seen
something therein that he had not.
</p>

<p>
'Did you not see the announcement of&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of what?' he asked, impetuously, as
Mrs. Trelawney paused, her lips apparently
unable to tell to what she referred, and
with tremulous hands she took up a
morning paper and searched for a particular
paragraph or passage, while Goring felt his
heart sickening, as he never doubted it
referred to the marriage of Alison, who, he
feared, had yielded to her father's iron
influence at last.
</p>

<p>
'Read this&mdash;but nerve yourself first, my
dear friend,' said Mrs. Trelawney, in her
sweet low voice.
</p>

<p>
'It is confidently asserted that the
English yacht reported as having been sunk
some weeks ago in a midnight collision with
the lugger <i>Le Chien Noir</i>, of Ostend, off
the mouth of the Maese, is Lord Cadbury's
beautiful brigantine the <i>Firefly</i>, so well
known at the Cowes Regattas.  Sir Ranald
Cheyne of Essilmont and suite were on
board.'
</p>

<p>
He grew deadly pale and reeled, but,
recovering, read the fatal paragraph again
and again, till the letters seemed
photographed on his brain, and he was scarcely
conscious.  Mrs. Dalton, as we must call
her now, was in tears, and had taken his
left hand caressingly between her own.
</p>

<p>
'Shocked as I am by this news, which I
trust in heaven may be untrue, I am
shocked,' said she, 'to be first to break it
to you; but you must have learned it in
time, and perhaps even more abruptly, and
from those less able to sympathise with you.'
</p>

<p>
He covered his eyes and did not speak.
</p>

<p>
'You observed,' said Laura, 'that the
writer says it is <i>reported</i>&mdash;which leaves
room for hope&mdash;and we were told that the
yacht had gone to the Mediterranean.'
</p>

<p>
'Which I began to suspect was a ruse,
and this awful intelligence seems to prove
that I was right,' said Goring, in a very
broken voice.  'My poor Alison&mdash;my poor
Alison.'
</p>

<p>
He threw himself into a chair, and a
silence for some minutes ensued.
</p>

<p>
Separation and opposition were to be
looked forward to, and had been encountered
and effected.  Even a marriage with
Lord Cadbury was not improbable; had
not his own heart told him so but a few
minutes before?  But a catastrophe like
this&mdash;death&mdash;death by drowning&mdash;was
altogether unlooked for!
</p>

<p>
Sad and broken was the conversation
now between him and Laura Dalton, and
they could but surmise and conjecture in
vain, while he lingered long with her, as he
clung to her presence and society for
sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Drowned&mdash;gone&mdash;out of the world&mdash;away
from him, and for ever!  It seemed
incredible, unrealisable!
</p>

<p>
He recalled more powerfully than ever
now her loving words, her tender and
winning expression of eye; again he felt
in memory the pressure of her soft little
hand, her gentle kisses, and the sea seemed
to give up its dead at the only exorcism
it will obey&mdash;that of a bereaved and faithful
heart&mdash;and his beloved was with him as
on that last time he saw her face.
</p>

<p>
'Drowned&mdash;lost!' he struck his hands
together, and often passed one across his
eyes, as if to clear away a mist before him.
</p>

<p>
And he thought&mdash;he could think of
nothing else&mdash;of her delicate and beloved
form being the sport of the cold, dark
waves&mdash;it might be the prey of the dwellers
therein&mdash;that awful grave, without turf or
flowers, which no sunshine would ever
brighten to his eyes&mdash;the cruel sea that had
taken her from him for ever!
</p>

<p>
Times there were when but for this
feature in his loss he might have thanked
Heaven that it was death&mdash;only death&mdash;that
separated him from his darling,
and not a degrading marriage with that
odious old man.  And in the extremity
of his grief he at times forgot to feel anger
at either him or her father for the
catastrophe they were the unintentional means
of bringing about.
</p>

<p>
But anger and rage too were coming soon.
</p>

<p>
When Goring was sitting like a man
turned to stone, evincing little sign of life
save when he sighed heavily, Laura Dalton
kindly laid a hand on his shoulder and
said,
</p>

<p>
'The dépôt is fully formed and in working
order now.  Leave the command of it
to the next officer, young Fleming, and, as
you will not be wanted at Aldershot till
the spring drills commence, go personally
and search for intelligence.'
</p>

<p>
'Search&mdash;where&mdash;at the bottom of the
sea?' said Goring, huskily.
</p>

<p>
'The yacht is said to have been sunk
off the Maese; people at Maeseland-Sluys or
Rotterdam may know something about it.
Get leave, go there and inquire, you will
be useless here, my dear Goring, and a
burden to yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'Right, I thank you,' he exclaimed, starting
up; 'it is a good suggestion.'
</p>

<p>
'Is not anything better than sitting still a
prey to wretchedness and one's miserable
thoughts?' she said, feelingly, as she
referred, perhaps, to some time or passages in
her own past life.
</p>

<p>
Goring resolved to take measures for
trying his too probably useless and hopeless
search at once.  He promised faithfully to
write to Laura Dalton informing her of his
progress, and of every fragment of
intelligence he could pick up&mdash;telegraphing to
her in the first place.  He pressed her
hand, kissed her on the forehead, and in
another minute was in his saddle, and
galloping back to Aldershot at a break-neck
speed&mdash;at a rate which would certainly have
made his nag remonstrate had it possessed
the gift of speech.
</p>

<p>
He had wealth enough certainly to satisfy
all the requirements&mdash;the wishes of Sir
Ranald Cheyne; but what did it avail him
now?  It would neither restore the dead
nor his own peace of mind.  And now he
could but do, as he had done a hundred
times before, softly open the clasp of her
engagement ring&mdash;her brother Ellon's
ring&mdash;and gaze upon her features, and the tiny
lock of hair, while his heart was wrung
within him.
</p>

<p>
He dashed off his application for leave,
and had it at once despatched.  He
commanded the inlying piquet that night, and,
like an automaton, had to go through the
formula of parading it in line with forage
caps, great-coats, and side arms, and seeing
the camp patrolled between retreat and half
an hour after the first post of tattoo.
</p>

<p>
Never would he forget the gloom of that
few hours' duty, which seemed to be done,
not by himself, but some one else.  He
had a curious and perplexing sense of a
dual existence.
</p>

<p>
Would leave be refused him?  That was
not to be thought of.
</p>

<p>
He could not rest in his hut alone.  Nearly
all that night he wandered about the silent
camp like an evil or unquiet spirit, challenged
again and again by great-coated sentinels,
who marvelled whether this officer
who passed their posts so often, and to all
appearance so aimlessly, was demented or
not; and so, for hours and hours of a
gloomy and inclement night, he roved about,
and heard the wind swaying the tops of the
trees.  He shivered, and tried to collect his
thoughts, but seemed to have none to
collect.
</p>

<p>
He tried to reason with himself, but,
whatever idea suggested itself, one was
always uppermost&mdash;Alison drowned, Alison
in the cruel and merciless sea.
</p>

<p>
'I must get out of this place, do something,
pull myself together, or I shall go
mad,' he muttered.
</p>

<p>
Was he dreaming? was all this sorrow a
vision of the night that would pass away?
</p>

<p>
Till the morning gun boomed from Gun
Hill, and the sweet low reveille began to
steal out on the moistened air, he continued
to wander thus, till, drenched with the dews
of night, he retired to his hut, and flinging
himself upon his bed, endeavoured to sleep
for an hour or two&mdash;the sleep of utter
exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
From this happy state he was soon roused
by an uproarious rattling at the door of his
room, and his subaltern, Frank Fleming, in
undress uniform&mdash;a heedless, noisy young
fellow, and a second edition of Jerry
Wilmot, but neither revised nor
corrected&mdash;came bustling in, shouting,
</p>

<p>
'The black ball is hoisted <i>alone</i> at
headquarters.  Thank God!'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?' asked Goring, in a
weak voice, but angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Mean, man alive! don't you know?  It
means that the parade is cancelled.'
</p>

<p>
'I had forgotten, but, till I dismiss the
piquet, parades are nothing to me,' said
Goring, turning his face to the wall, and
Fleming departed, fully believing from the
manner and appearance of his senior officer
that 'he was screwed tight as a drum, by
Jove!&mdash;on duty, too!  I wonder the fellow
doesn't cut Aldershot now&mdash;he's rich
enough; can draw cheques galore; not get
them, like me, with strong paternal
comments, and perhaps well-deserved
objurgations.'
</p>

<p>
And Bevil Goring lay there in his hut,
hearing the incessant drums beating and
bugles sounding with a dazed feeling, as if
he had been shot into another world.  With
him it was&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh, love for a year, a month, a day,<br>
  But alas for the love that loves alway!'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'What the devil is up with Goring?' said
Fleming and others of the dépôt; 'within
the last few days he has looked older by
ten years&mdash;worn and worried&mdash;not at all
like a man who has just come into a fine
pot of money.'
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
THE JOURNEY.
</h3>

<p>
At last he got his leave of absence and
was off for London.  Food remained
before him almost untasted or forgotten.
He ate eventually, but very sparingly, like
one who knows it should be partaken of
only for strength to achieve some task that
was to come.
</p>

<p>
'We no longer travel,' wrote Thackeray,
with reference to some of the improvements
of the age; 'we are carried from
place to place,' and Goring was sensible of
what another writer calls 'the tedious hurry
of locomotion,' as he was swept on his way
to Harwich by the 7 p.m. train from the
great bustling and brilliantly lighted station
at Liverpool Street.
</p>

<p>
There are few among us who have not
undergone at some period of our lives that
intolerable fever of spirit, when setting out
on some journey or errand, the eventuality
of which may be the life or death of some
one loved well and dearly.  The heart and
soul annihilating space, traverse the journey
in an instant; the helpless longing body, no
matter at how swift a rate it may be
progressing, seems to stand stock-still, and the
imposed inaction becomes a physical torture
that is to a certain extent merciful, since for
the time it partially paralyses the action of
the brain.
</p>

<p>
All this, or something like it, was
endured by Bevil Goring, while the swift
express tidal train sped on its way through
the darkness of the night by Witham with
its long and almost solitary street; through
Colchester, getting but a glimpse of the
winding valley overlooked by its old castle;
by Manningtree, Bradfield, and welcome to
his ears was the cry of 'Harwich,' and he
became sensible of the cold sea-breeze as
the train went clanking into the station, on
the tongue of land between the mouths of
the Stour and the Orwell; and a minute
more saw him with his railway-rugs in a
strap hurrying after the porter who
shouldered his portmanteau.
</p>

<p>
'What steamer, sir?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Rotterdam.'
</p>

<p>
'All right, sir&mdash;here you are.'
</p>

<p>
A vision of a red funnel amid the uncertain
glow of many coloured lights and lanterns,
a bustle and the jarring of ropes and
chains, with the clank of donkey-engines
and goods swung in mid-air from derricks,
ascending and descending, much shouting
and swearing and hurrying to and fro over
slippery decks and piles of luggage covered
by wet tarpaulins, a bearded man on the
gangway, lantern in hand, viewing the
tickets and passing the travellers on board;
and then with a sigh of relief&mdash;almost
satisfaction&mdash;Goring found himself in the cabin
of the steamer.
</p>

<p>
'State room or locker, sir?' asked the
steward, touching his cap.
</p>

<p>
'A locker&mdash;there, that will do,' said
Goring, as he threw his rugs on one and looked
round him.  He saw 'Rotterdam' on everything,
from the front of the steward's cap to
the glasses in the trays that swung between
the beams, and after a brandy and seltzer
he lit a cigar and went on deck as the screw
began to revolve, the shore-warps fell
plashing from the timber heads into the
water, and way was made upon the vessel.
</p>

<p>
There were but few passengers on board,
and these few, as yet, seemed disposed to
be surly, suspicious, and to keep apart from
each other in true John Bull fashion.
</p>

<p>
A bright and beautiful moon shed its
silvery light upon the smooth but rippling
water, and by half-past nine the clang of
the Bell Buoy began to grow fainter and
fainter as the steamer headed seaward, and
the many red and green lights on the flat
shore began to fade out and melt into the
uncertain haze.
</p>

<p>
Long did Bevil Goring remain on deck
alone, sunk in deep and sad thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Was she indeed beneath those moonlit
waves over which he was so swiftly gliding.
He shivered as he looked at them, and
turned his eyes to the star-studded sky; at
last he wearied of the incessant repetitions
from the watch to the man at the wheel,
'starboard,' 'port,' 'hard-a-port, 'steady,'
every ten minutes or so when a vessel came
near, and the tiresome iteration of their
orders only ceased when the fog-horns
began to sound, when the anchor was let
go near a long line of lights that twinkled
dimly through mist upon the shore to the
eastward, and Bevil Goring knew that he
was now close in on the Continent.
</p>

<p>
Midnight was long since past, and he
went below; the weary steward was still
yawning in his pantry, when Bevil thought
another brandy and seltzer would do him
no harm.
</p>

<p>
'How long may we be here?' he asked,
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'Till the fog lifts, sir, or day breaks,
certainly.'
</p>

<p>
'Then we may not get to Rotterdam till
midday?'
</p>

<p>
'Rotterdam, did you say, sir?' asked the
steward, with a stare of surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, sir, this is the Antwerp boat, and
these lights on shore are Flushing&mdash;we're
in the Scheldt.'
</p>

<p>
Goring was exasperated on hearing this&mdash;a
cause of delay and trouble quite unexpected.
</p>

<p>
'I was told distinctly that this was the
Rotterdam boat.'
</p>

<p>
'So it is, sir, in a way&mdash;it is <i>the</i> Rotterdam,
bound for Antwerp.  Where <i>was</i> you
going to?'
</p>

<p>
Goring explained, on which the steward
mixed himself a glass of grog, laughed, and
said it was a jolly mistake.  Goring,
however, failed to see the jollity of it, and
began to consult a railway guide to trace
out his route from Antwerp the moment he
landed there, by Breda, to the city on the
Maese.
</p>

<p>
While thus employed, he asked the
steward if he had heard of a collision some
time ago near the mouth of that river, in
which an English yacht had suffered.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir,' replied the steward, 'but
it wasn't quite off the mouth of the Maese.'
</p>

<p>
'Where, then?'
</p>

<p>
'More to the south'ard&mdash;somewhere off
the coast of Walchern.'
</p>

<p>
'It was Lord Cadbury's yacht.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir, so I heard.'
</p>

<p>
'What happened?' asked Goring, making
an effort to control himself and conceal his
agitation, which was totally unperceived by
the steward, who was collecting from the
table all the glasses and decanters left by
the passengers, who were now rolled up in
rugs, and stowed away in their berths or on
lockers.
</p>

<p>
'One of the craft was sunk.'
</p>

<p>
'Which?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't know, sir, precisely.'
</p>

<p>
'Were any drowned?'
</p>

<p>
'Some o' course, sir&mdash;a young woman, for one.'
</p>

<p>
'A young lady?' gasped Bevil.
</p>

<p>
'Can't say, sir&mdash;coming, sir!' he added,
in reply to a voice that hailed from near
the rudder-case; 'whisky grogs for two&mdash;flash
o' lightning and gin cock-tail for the
two American gents,' he added to his
assistant; while Goring betook himself to the
little cuddy on deck, and sat there with a
very benumbed and stunned feeling about
him; while once more the vibration of the
vessel and the everlasting
'Hard-a-port&mdash;Starboard&mdash;steady' announced that the
steamer was again under way; that the fog
had lifted; and that she was gliding up the
waters of the Scheldt, on each side of
which not a vestige of the flat shore was
visible as yet.
</p>

<p>
All inclination to sleep had departed
from Bevil Goring; yet he was very weary,
and a year seemed to have elapsed since he
threw off his uniform and donned mufti
at Aldershot, and had seen the green and
red lights of Harwich Pier fade into the
sea.
</p>

<p>
Trees that seemed to grow amid the
water, fringes of low willow-clad banks,
distant spires and windmills began to peep
up on either hand in the grey light of the
morning, and the earlier part of noon was
creeping on, when, long before they were
near the city of Antwerp, the spire of its
glorious cathedral, one of the finest
specimens of Gothic architecture in Europe, the
carving of which is like Mechlin lace, and
which Charles V. said was so delicate in its
workmanship that it would require a case
to preserve it, seemed to start sheer from
the surface of the water&mdash;a curious effect
produced by the immensity of its height,
which, as it towers skywards, dwarfs to toys
the really lofty houses that cluster round it.
</p>

<p>
On past the green sloping glacis and
grassy embrasures of the citadel&mdash;one of
the strongest in Europe&mdash;glided the steamer.
As she did so, Goring could little foresee a
remarkable morning, an episode in his own
life, he was to spend on the ramparts of
that Belgian fortress.  Nearer she drew to
the shore, with its quaint houses of the
Middle Ages, all crow-stepped gables and
curious windows; nearer to the wharves,
where lay piles of goods coming from or
going to every part of the world; and now,
dockmen, porters, hotel-touts, and
wharfingers began to rush hurriedly, to and fro,
while gendarmes in blue, with rifle and
sword, smoked their cigarettes, looking
placidly on; and Bevil Goring did so as
one in a dream.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes more, while the steam
blew off with a roar, and the <i>Rotterdam</i> was
moored alongside the great Quai Van Dyck.
On one side lay the city, with all its vast
wet docks; on the other the green, receding
Tête de Flandres; between them a river,
in size far exceeding the Thames at
London; and far in the west the shadowy
isles, with which the eye, from the spire,
may see that the mouth of the Scheldt is
crowded.
</p>

<p>
Barring all passage shoreward, at the end
of the gangway, about which the passengers
were crowding impatiently with their
travelling-bags and portmanteaus, stood a <i>douanier</i>,
or custom-house officer, in blue uniform,
with the inevitable kepi (worn by every
official in Antwerp, from the general
commanding the garrison to the milk and
butterman), bearded, grim, impassive, and, like
all Belgian under-functionaries, disposed to
insolence, dilatoriness, and to annoy the
traveller, thereby contrasting singularly with
the punctuality and politeness of similar
officials in France and Austria.
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring's baggage, a simple portmanteau,
had been opened, examined, passed,
and marked with the usual cabalistic figures
in white chalk, and the steward, in expectation
of a small fee, was re-strapping it, when
he suddenly drew Bevil's attention to a
remarkably beautiful little vessel, cutter-rigged
aft and brig forward, with a breach in her
bulwarks, on which a gang of riggers were
setting up a new foretopmast and foretopgallant
mast, with their hamper, cross-yards,
and so forth.  She lay alongside the quay,
and just astern of the steamer.
</p>

<p>
Impatient only to get ashore and drive to
the railway for Rotterdam, Bevil was about
to hurry up the gangway, when the steward said,
</p>

<p>
'<i>That's</i> the yacht as you were asking
about, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Lord Cadbury's&mdash;the <i>Firefly</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Then she was not sunk?'
</p>

<p>
'Sunk; no, she couldn't have been, for
there she lies, as the Flushing pilot has just
told me.  <i>She</i> sunk the lugger off the mouth
of the Scheldt, and was towed up here to
re-fit.  And a regular beauty she is.'
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring felt his heart leap, and,
giddy with many emotions, forced his way
rather unceremoniously up the gangway,
and, with his portmanteau in one hand and
his roll of railway-rugs in the other, leaped
from the quay on the deck of the yacht.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
A SNARE.
</h3>

<p>
A smart, sailor-like fellow, wearing an
Oxford jacket and naval cap, and
who seemed to be in authority, as he was
overlooking the riggers, who were swaying
up and fidding the topmast, now turned
and gave him a glance of inquiry, as much
as to say, 'Now, who are you, and what do
you want?'
</p>

<p>
'This is the <i>Firefly</i>, Lord Cadbury's yacht?'
</p>

<p>
'It is.'
</p>

<p>
'You had an accident at sea&mdash;a collision;
did anything else happen, were any lives
lost?' asked Goring, impetuously and nervously.
</p>

<p>
'May I ask who is inquiring?' said the
other.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Goring, of the Rifle Brigade.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, a friend of his lordship's, I presume?'
</p>

<p>
'No, though I have met him.  And you?'
</p>

<p>
'I am Tom Llanyard, at your service&mdash;his
lordship's skipper, but in Her Majesty's
service, like yourself, once.  Lives were
lost&mdash;some of the Ostend lubbers, who
failed to hang out a light.'
</p>

<p>
'Any of the yacht?'
</p>

<p>
'Only Daisy Prune, Miss Cheyne's maid.
Poor little girl, I did my best to save her,
but a wave took her out of my grasp.'
</p>

<p>
Human grief is perhaps rather selfish;
thus it was rather a relief to Goring when
he heard that the poor human life lost was
that of 'only Daisy Prune.'
</p>

<p>
'Miss Cheyne?'
</p>

<p>
'Is well, or was well when she left the
yacht three weeks ago, but Sir Ranald was
seriously injured by a swinging block.  Step
below, Captain Goring, and have a glass of
wine.  You look fagged.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks,' replied Goring, who was giddy
again with the mere revulsion of feeling,
and felt an emotion of great thankfulness
that he had so suddenly, so unexpectedly
lighted upon the direct track of those he
was in search of.  Hitherto he had only
looked forward to tidings&mdash;if any&mdash;of death,
not life, and it might be of unhappiness.
</p>

<p>
He stepped into the handsome little
saloon of the yacht, which had all the
luxury and elegance of a sea-going boudoir.
</p>

<p>
'Pemmican,' cried Llanyard to the
steward, 'glasses, some dry sherry, and a
biscuit; too early for grog, I suppose, sir,
as the sun is not over the foreyard.  That
was Miss Cheyne's cabin,' he added,
indicating a little state-room, the occupation
of which by her gave it an interest in
his eyes and still more in the eyes of his
listener; 'yes, sir, her cabin, and may
be again, if she sails with us.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' replied Goring, thinking it might
be unwise to exhibit too much interest;
'where is Lord Cadbury just now?'
</p>

<p>
'They are all at a hotel in Antwerp.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>All!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;Lord Cadbury, Sir Ranald, and
Miss Cheyne.'
</p>

<p>
'What hotel?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't precisely know&mdash;I'm seldom on
shore myself, and, when I do, never go
beyond the Hôtel d'Angleterre on the quay,
as I know neither French nor Flemish, and
might get stranded.  But Gaskins knows
where they are, and he's on board just
now.'
</p>

<p>
'Gaskins&mdash;who is he?'
</p>

<p>
'His lordship's groom and valet.  Pemmican,
pass the word forward for Gaskins&mdash;that
is, if you want to know.'
</p>

<p>
'I wish to know very much,' said Goring,
scarcely able to restrain his impatience.
</p>

<p>
Gaskins appeared, just as we saw him
last, looking the perfection of an English
groom, with a short, dark-grey surtout
buttoned to the throat, spotless white tie and
cords, long-bodied and short-legged, a straw
in his mouth, a flower at his button-hole,
and a sudden twinkle of intense cunning in
his half-closed eyes, as he recognised Bevil
Goring (whom he had often seen out with
the hounds), and at once took in the whole
situation.  He had not been so long in
Lord Cadbury's service as not to know
what brought him to Antwerp.
</p>

<p>
'This gentleman wishes to know Lord
Cadbury's hotel,' said Tom Llanyard.
</p>

<p>
Gaskins touched his cockaded hat, and
affected to think.  He paused and scratched
his chin.
</p>

<p>
'Can't you say?' said Goring, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'He has changed it, sir, lately; we are
now at the&mdash;the "Red Lion" in the "Roo
de Cos," I think it is called.'
</p>

<p>
'We, meaning also Sir Ranald and Miss Cheyne?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks.  And now, Mr. Llanyard, I
shall bid you good morning,' and, shaking
the sailor's hand, Goring went on deck.
</p>

<p>
'Here are your railway rugs, sir,' said
Gaskins, following him thither up the
companion-way.
</p>

<p>
Goring took the handle of the straps in
his hand, nodded his thanks, and went on
shore; but had he looked back he might
have been puzzled to perceive the extraordinary
grin that overspread the visage of
Mr. Gaskins, and the manner in which that
gentleman slapped his thigh and then his
mouth, making thereby the loud sound of
drawing a cork.
</p>

<p>
He then whispered something in the ear
of a gendarme who was standing on the
quay.  The latter looked over the voiture,
or cab, into which Goring was stepping,
and, after eyeing Gaskins keenly, made an
entry in his note-book.
</p>

<p>
The latter then jumped into a tramway
'bus, which he knew passed the hotel
patronised by Lord Cadbury, to whom he
betook himself in all haste to report
matters, and that Captain Goring was in
Antwerp!
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Was it fate, good fortune, or 'Cupid,
king of gods and men,' that had led him so
kindly, so fortunately, to blunder at
Harwich, and get on board the wrong boat,
which eventually proved the <i>right</i> one for
him?
</p>

<p>
With his sense of exultation there was
mingled a prayerful emotion of great
thankfulness that Alison had escaped amid the
horror of the catastrophe, and that she was,
as Llanyard asserted, well.
</p>

<p>
To see her, to have speech with her, to
carry her off, now that he could lay wealth
at her feet, were the next things to achieve,
and to that end it would never do to put
up at the same hotel&mdash;that mentioned by
Gaskins, the groom; and, truth to tell, he
would have had some difficulty in doing
that.  So he selected another&mdash;the Hôtel
du Parc&mdash;the name of which he gave the
driver of the voiture in which he was
conveyed.  Oh, how lightly and happily beat
his heart as he went!&mdash;past buildings and
streets, all demolished now or being so for
the construction of those vast new docks,
which will be the boast of Antwerp, and by
the Rue Reynders, to the open and spacious
Place Verte, where the graceful statue of
Rubens in cavalier costume stands, and the
north side of which is almost entirely
formed by the towering masses of the
glorious cathedral.
</p>

<p>
She was living&mdash;thank heaven!&mdash;living
and well! was his incessant thought.  He
had no longer her loss&mdash;her death&mdash;to
sorrow for; but he had her deliverance to
achieve.  To wait a year&mdash;no! there was
no need for that now; and he felt as if she
were his already.
</p>

<p>
But they had all been some time in Antwerp;
what if Cadbury's influence and her
father's authority had prevailed, and&mdash;but&mdash;no!
He thrust <i>that</i> idea aside, and
entered the dining-room of the Hôtel du
Parc, while the waiter settled with the
driver and took charge of his luggage.
</p>

<p>
'What accommodation did monsieur want?'
</p>

<p>
'Only a bed-room.'
</p>

<p>
'For to-night only?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;for some days, weeks perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur had come to see the churches,
the galleries, the Musée Plantin, and all
that?'
</p>

<p>
'Precisely!' exclaimed Goring, with impatience.
</p>

<p>
'Luncheon, monsieur?' suggested the
garrulous waiter, and, to be partly rid of
him and left to himself, Goring ordered it.
</p>

<p>
Many hotels overlooked the Place Verte;
was she in one of them?  Perhaps her
eyes were at that same moment looking on
what he saw there; and the tall edifices
with smokeless chimneys, the result of the
general use of stoves in houses, some old
enough and quaint enough to have been
seen by Charles V.; the little carts drawn
by dogs; the little yellow police-vans
proceeding to and from the Palais de Justice,
escorted by soldier-looking gendarmes in
blue tunics, with white braid and aiglettes,
bear-skin caps, and carbines; women
without caps, or with queer poke bonnets and
long dark cloaks; the funeral of a 'Liberal'
going past&mdash;the hearse without cross,
candles, or priests, and preceded by a
great brass band playing polkas and
mazurkas; the Calvarys and Madonnas at
the street corners, or in the porte-cochère
of houses, all with lamps before them;
municipal guards with plumed hats; artizans
in blouses and sabots; shabby ill set up
soldiers of all sorts and sizes, in baggy
trousers, queer forage caps, and enormous
red worsted shoulder knots&mdash;soldiers
between whose appearance and that of 'our
fellows,' Goring drew comparisons not very
favourable to the former; priests in shovel
hats and long floating cloaks or soutanes,
one perhaps preceded by a cross-bearer and
acolyte with a bell, bearing the Blessed
Sacrament to the dying.
</p>

<p>
High overhead the sweet carillons or
musical bells, so common to all the churches
in Belgium, were playing merrily in the
cathedral spire, from whence, ever and anon
announcing the hours and half hours, came
the sonorous booms of that vast bell at the
baptism of which Charles V. stood as
'godfather,' and which requires the united
strength of sixteen men to pull it.
</p>

<p>
For the first time during a past period
Bevil Goring had an appetite, and was well
disposed to do justice to the cuisine of the
Hôtel du Parc&mdash;and, truth to tell, the
Belgian cookery is second to none in the
world; and after having <i>pâté de foie gras</i>,
and dainty cutlets of veal, richly egg and
bread crumbed to perfection, with pastry
from Meurice's in the Marché aux Œufs,
without which no meal seems perfect in
Antwerp, and a glass or two of Chablis, he
thought he might as well ask a question or
two of the garrulous waiter, who was
hovering about, with a white towel over
his left shoulder, his thick short hair oiled,
and his moustache waxed and pointed
<i>à la empereur</i>.
</p>

<p>
'What is your name?'
</p>

<p>
'Jacquot, monsieur,' he replied, adopting
the first position in dancing, smiling suavely,
and pressing his hands together, or working
them, as Dickens says, 'with invisible soap
in imperceptible water.'
</p>

<p>
'In what part of Antwerp is the Rue
d'Ecosse&mdash;is it near the Place Verte?'
</p>

<p>
'Rue d'Ecosse, monsieur&mdash;there is no such
street in Antwerp.'
</p>

<p>
'Think again, Jacquot, please.  I want
the Hôtel Lion Rouge, Rue d'Ecosse.'
</p>

<p>
'I assure you, monsieur, that there is no
such street and no such hotel,' replied
Jacquot, emphatically.
</p>

<p>
'I am not mistaken,' thought Goring.
'Can that rascally groom, in the interests
of his master, have been deceiving me?'
</p>

<p>
As he had no reason for doubting that
the waiter was correct in his statistics, he
felt doubt and anger rise in his heart at the
anticipation of trouble and difficulty; for
if this fellow Gaskins had recognised and
deceived him he would at once sound an
alarm.
</p>

<p>
'Have you heard of an English milord in
Antwerp called Milord Cadbury?'
</p>

<p>
'No, monsieur.  There are many hotels;
he may be in one.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you a visitors' list in Antwerp?'
</p>

<p>
'No, monsieur; but here is the Brussels
English newspaper, which may contain what
monsieur wants.'
</p>

<p>
It was and is a weekly periodical, which
gives the names of all visitors to the
Belgian capital and its adjacent cities and
towns, and after a brief search Goring
found the names of 'Lord Cadbury, Sir
Ranald Cheyne, and Miss Cheyne,' as being
located at the Hôtel St. Antoine.
</p>

<p>
'Where is that hotel?'
</p>

<p>
'Close by, monsieur&mdash;at the corner of
the Place, adjoining the Marché aux Souliers.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, Jacquot,' replied Goring, who
began to breathe more freely.  'Now to
consider what my plans must be,' he thought.
'I must not be rash, but I must act on the
instant, as it is quite on the cards that
Cadbury may shift their tents to Brussels or
elsewhere.'
</p>

<p>
He twisted his moustache and almost
ground his teeth at that idea.
</p>

<p>
'<i>If</i> he does,' thought he, 'and I can ever
lay hands on him, I will parade him at
daybreak&mdash;by heavens I will!&mdash;with an
officer from the nearest barracks as my
second.  There is no explicit law against
duelling here as at home, so, my Lord
Cadbury, I may make your little game a dear
one for you in the end.  Now, however, to
write to Laura Dalton, or shall I telegraph?'
</p>

<p>
Jacquot, who had left the room for a
minute, now came in with some perturbation
in his face and manner.
</p>

<p>
'An officer of gendarmes wishes to see
you, monsieur, immediately, and has given
an order to seize your luggage.'
</p>

<p>
'To see me&mdash;to seize my luggage!  What
the devil does the fellow mean?' exclaimed
Goring, who was prompt enough to ire, as
he started up from the table on seeing an
officer of gendarmes, with his sword at his
side, without salute or moving his cap,
bluntly enter the room, while giving an
order to some others who were outside.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
We have said that Bevil Goring had
promised to write to Laura Dalton reporting
what discoveries he made of the fate of
Alison.
</p>

<p>
But day followed day at Chilcote Grange
after his departure, and neither letter nor
telegram came from him; and Laura,
who was really full of anxiety and concern
for both amid her own personal causes for
serious thought, began to think that he too
had disappeared.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
THE HÔTEL ST. ANTOINE.
</h3>

<p>
At the very time that Bevil Goring,
unconscious of mischief being worked
against him, was discussing his cutlets and
Chablis at the Hôtel du Parc, Mr. Gaskins
was having an interview with his master,
Lord Cadbury, at the adjacent Hôtel St. Antoine.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Goring in Antwerp!' exclaimed
the latter.  'How the devil has he discovered
that we are here, for that circumstance
alone can have brought him at a season
when no one travels, and I have sedulously
kept my name out of the London papers.'
</p>

<p>
'It is the greatest lark out!' said Gaskins,
bursting for the third time into an explosion
of laughter.
</p>

<p>
'What <i>is</i> the greatest lark&mdash;what do you
mean, Gaskins?' asked the peer, with some
asperity, while staring at his dependent.
</p>

<p>
'You remember the arrest of one of these
Belgian rigger fellows, who were repairing
the yacht, as a Liberal communist, or
something of that kind, my lord?'
</p>

<p>
'Perfectly well.'
</p>

<p>
'He threw into a locker of the cabin some
printed revolutionary manifestoes, which
were found yesterday by Captain Llanyard,
who meant to destroy them, so as to have
no bother about the matter; but I slipped
them into the railway rugs of that ere
Captain Goring, gave the straight tip to
a <i>jangdarum</i>, and I have no doubt that before
night he will be arrested.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury actually joined in the explosion
of merriment with which his valet concluded
this revelation of rascality.
</p>

<p>
'Egad, you are a genius, Gaskins,'
said he; 'but did Llanyard see you do this?'
</p>

<p>
'No, my lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Or anyone else?'
</p>

<p>
'No, I took jolly good care of that.'
</p>

<p>
'On this charge he will be kept close till
we can clear out of Antwerp by sea if the
yacht is ready in time, or to Brussels, if
only Sir Ranald would get well.  But you
spoke to a gendarme, you say.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Your evidence will be wanted&mdash;perhaps
you did not think of that?'
</p>

<p>
Gaskins' nether jaw dropped at this suggestion.
</p>

<p>
'These Belgian and French police are
the devils to have anything to do with!'
said his master; 'and <i>my</i> name must not be
mixed up with this affair.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not, my lord,' said Gaskins,
with a cough.
</p>

<p>
'Put off your livery at once, change your
clothes, and take an early train to Brussels.
Keep out of the way till I send for you&mdash;and
write to me your whereabouts.'
</p>

<p>
And, highly tickled by the whole affair,
he gave a handful of money to Gaskins for
his expenses.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, my lord, I am off like a
bird,' said that worthy, and he departed
singing the music hall ditty, 'Love is like a
cup of tea.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove!  Captain Goring won't find it so!&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Lovely woman is the sugar;<br>
  Spoons we poor men often be&mdash;"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'<i>La-la-de-da!</i>  Miss Cheyne,' and, chuckling
over the mischief he thought he had
put in motion, Mr. Gaskins took his departure
from the Hôtel St. Antoine in a cab for
the station of <i>Chemin de fer de l'Etat</i>, near
the Zoological Gardens.
</p>

<p>
Cadbury's jealousy was roused again; he
was most thoroughly enraged by the idea
of Goring being at Antwerp when he was
beginning to think he had Alison almost as
much to himself as she had been when in
the yacht; and yet he did not see much of
her, as she was so constantly in attendance
upon the sick-bed of her father.
</p>

<p>
Cadbury's fancy for her was a peculiar
one.  It was not love, we have before said;
not that his day for what he thought that
sentiment to be, was past, 'because,' as a
writer says, 'till the grave has closed over
him, it is impossible to say of any man that
his day for that, or its <i>fac-simile</i>, infatuation,
is finished.'
</p>

<p>
All his life he had been engaged in
<i>affaires du cœur</i>&mdash;affairs more or less coarse;
but never before had he found a girl of such
refinement, beauty, and character as Alison
Cheyne thrown by the mere force of
circumstances almost on his mercy; and now,
after all the trouble he had taken, the
expense of taking up the bills collected by
Solomon Slagg, her aversion and resistance
piqued and perhaps exasperated him, and
he longed for the time when he should feel
that he triumphed over and humbled her,
he cared little how.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'How long&mdash;oh, Lord!&mdash;how long is this
life of weariness and anxiety to last and be
endured?'
</p>

<p>
It was Alison who said this, in a whisper
to herself, as she sat in the half-lighted
room, in which her father lay a-bed, ill, and
sick, and faint, his head still suffering from
the blow he had received on the night of
the collision&mdash;a blow that nearly gave him
concussion of the brain, and might yet
prove serious at his years, and with his now
broken constitution.
</p>

<p>
He lay in the plain but not unluxurious
bed-room of a Belgian hotel&mdash;the St. Antoine.
The walls were lofty, papered with
sage-green paper; the bare and uncarpeted
oak floor was varnished and polished like
the face of a mirror; a cheerful fire was in
the square black iron stove that stood in
front of the carved oak mantelpiece,
whereon was an elegant French clock, above
which rose a lofty mirror, and on each side
of which were large vases full of flowers,
arranged by the hands of Alison&mdash;chiefly
roses, which at that season are brought all
the way from Nice to Antwerp&mdash;by railway,
of course.
</p>

<p>
She heard the carillons sounding pleasantly
in the evening air high overhead apparently,
and ever and anon the horns and
bells of the passing tramway-cars as they
glided through the Place Verte.
</p>

<p>
Among the decorations of the bed-chamber
hung a large engraving of an English hunting
scene, with the dogs in full cry scampering
over fences and ditches, and her eyes
often wandered towards it, as, in her mind,
it was associated with the last day she had
been out with the Royal Buckhounds, and
rode from the green lane home to Chilcote
Beeches accompanied by Bevil Goring.  And
then from the picture she would turn to
watch her father's pale and sleeping face.
The grim visitant had more than once
seemed nigh; but Sir Ranald Cheyne clung
persistently to earth and earthly things.
</p>

<p>
Alison sat close to his bedside, for he
who lay there seemed&mdash;save some one far
away, she thought&mdash;all that she had to cling
to; she was in a circle of light shed by a
lamp upon a pedestal, and an unread Tauchnitz
volume lay on her lap forgotten&mdash;'Tales
of Flemish Life,' by Hendrik Conscience,
the Walter Scott of Flanders.
</p>

<p>
She looked pale, worn, and wan.  Sorrow
and trouble were beginning to tell upon
her now; wakeful nights, restless days, and
incessant anxious thoughts were all robbing
her of the bloom of perfect youth; the
sweetness of lip, the softness of brow, the
light of eye, were all passing away, and
even her voice was changing, and becoming
starved and thin, if we may use the
expression.  While in the yacht she had
escaped her father's peevishness to some
extent, and the misery of her home life in
another, with its struggle for appearances
and bare existence, its saving and scraping,
and the duns of ever urgent creditors; but
then she had undergone the grief of a rough
separation from Bevil, with the annoyance
the presence of Lord Cadbury gave her.
</p>

<p>
'If I can only get through all this, nurse
papa well, and get back to Bevil, or to
where I can hear of him, how happy&mdash;how
thankful I shall be!'
</p>

<p>
Though absent in body, she was ever
present in spirit with Bevil; but how little
could she conceive that he was at that very
time so near her.
</p>

<p>
One of those horrible bats peculiar to
Antwerp, and which begin to flit about as
evening falls, came bang against the panes
of the lighted window and woke Sir Ranald.
</p>

<p>
'Still sitting there, bird Ailie,' said he,
'and not reading; of what are you thinking?'
</p>

<p>
'Of home.'
</p>

<p>
'What home&mdash;Chilcote or Essilmont?&mdash;of
course you prefer the former now?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I do not care particularly for
Chilcote; in my mind it is associated with
gloom and struggles; I had nothing on
earth to leave there but the fowls, the birds
I spread crumbs for, the apple-trees and the
flowers, and some little trifles, sketches,
books, and nick-nacks that had become
familiarly dear to me.'
</p>

<p>
But she did refer to the first and piercing
thought of her life&mdash;Bevil Goring.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Alison!' said her father, as she
kissed his brow and arranged his pillows,
'your little hands have quite enough to do
for me.'
</p>

<p>
'They are diminutive members, perhaps,
papa, but useful, anyway,' she replied, with
a faint smile.
</p>

<p>
'Here in Antwerp there are many things
you should see, poor child&mdash;the churches,
galleries, museums, the Steyne.  Cadbury
suggests I should get a nursing sister.  This
is dull work for you, darling, and you must
go out.'
</p>

<p>
'I could not bear to see another nursing
you.  It is not the custom here for young
girls to go out alone, and I have no
companion, no escort&mdash;not even poor little
Daisy Prune now.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, there is Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
She shivered at the name, and a gesture
of impatience and anger escaped her.  Well
used as she had grown, in the affection of
her heart, to subdue all emotions in the
presence of her ailing father, to whom she
had devoted herself, it was not in human
nature but to feel wroth at the trickery to
which she had been subjected, which had
caused Daisy Prune to lose her life, and by
which they might all have perished.
</p>

<p>
Her father had never ceased to urge
Cadbury's suit upon her in the intervals of
his strength, and as in the affectionate heart
of Alison there was a painful struggle
between contempt and pity, sorrow and
fear&mdash;contempt for his selfishness and avarice,
pity for his fallen pride, sorrow for his
condition, and a great fear of her own
future, for if he should die there she would
be utterly alone in the world&mdash;alone and
penniless in Antwerp!
</p>

<p>
Once she had thought he was nearly
gone, especially on the first night he had
been conveyed to the hotel from the
shattered yacht at the Quai Van Dyck; but
thanks to her care, more perhaps than even
the skill of a Belgian doctor, he had drifted
slowly but surely back from the confines of
the spirit world to consciousness and what
was comparative strength.
</p>

<p>
And when the latter came he at once
took up the weary and querulous <i>rôle</i> of
which the poor girl was so sick at heart.
</p>

<p>
She was never weary of pondering over
the strange fact that the name of the vessel
by which they had so nearly perished was
the <i>Black Hound</i>, of Ostend&mdash;the dog of
the family tradition.  It was certainly, to
say the least of it, a strange coincidence,
and many an instance of its alleged appearance
in time of woe occurred to her as she
sat brooding there.
</p>

<p>
Among others when an uncle of hers&mdash;a
younger brother of Sir Ranald&mdash;had gone
fishing up the Ythan at Ellon, and days
passed on without his returning.  A search
was made, and Archie Auchindoir saw a
black hound stealthily drinking at a pool in
the river, from which on his approach it
disappeared into a pine thicket, and soon
after he saw at the very spot where it had
been drinking the pallid face of her drowned
uncle appear, as his body came to the
surface.  This uncle had always been fond of
gazing into the water, either still or running,
and had often been heard to declare that
this pool&mdash;a famous salmon one&mdash;had a
strong fascination for him; and there he
came&mdash;none knew how&mdash;to his end.
</p>

<p>
And now, as she thought of these things,
the girl's memory wandered fondly away to
the pleasant days of her childhood at
Essilmont, where there were no high walls or
great houses, as here at Antwerp, to shut
out the pure air and bright sunshine of God,
but where all was so open and free; and
so, in fancy, she was again there, amid the
white snows of winter, when the Ythan was
frozen between its banks; the trees were
covered with glittering crystalline hoar
frost, and the braes were shrouded with
snow; when the primroses and violets of
spring peeped up under the budding timber;
when the forests were leafy in summer;
the fox-glove blazed ruddy amid the
green underwood, and when there was a
glow equal to dawn through all the short
June nights in the glorious north; and in
autumn, when the golden corn waved on
the upland slopes, and beautiful were the
fern and heath that covered the bonnie,
bonnie braes she might never look upon
again, and the tears of a great tenderness
and love of her old Scottish home welled
up in her eyes at the thought; but she dried
them in haste as she became aware that her
father was speaking to her again, and upon
the old obnoxious topic.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Alison, as I was saying&mdash;and you
seemed to assent by your silence&mdash;many
marriages turn out very well that have no
better basis than mutual liking.'
</p>

<p>
'But in this instance there would be
none; and on my side there are loathing
and contempt now!  How wise the frogs
were in Æsop; they had a great mind to
have some water, papa, but they did not
leap into the well lest they might not get
out again.'
</p>

<p>
'This is most objectionable language,
Alison,' exclaimed her father; 'how often
am I to remind you that the young ladies
of the world we move in&mdash;or should move
in&mdash;seldom marry for what poets and
fellows of that kind call love, but almost
invariably for money and position; and
Cadbury is certainly a more than eligible
candidate for your hand.'
</p>

<p>
'I should like, papa, to have some of
the brightness of a girl's life before I marry.'
</p>

<p>
'Alison, you could have as much brightness
after your marriage as any reasonable
being could desire.'
</p>

<p>
Alison was silent.
</p>

<p>
Brightness, she was thinking.  Yes, with
Bevil Goring, but not with Lord Cadbury.
Oh, why was Bevil so poor that he could
not boldly claim her at once; yet, poor
she deemed him to be, gladly would she
have cast her lot in life with him, but for
the opposition and wishes of the poor old
man who lay there.
</p>

<p>
'Think of how good, how kind Lord
Cadbury is, and of the expense to which
we must put him,' said Sir Ranald, after a
time.
</p>

<p>
'I think not of that; his kindness is
forced upon us; and surely I may consider
my own freedom of action, my own wishes,
tastes, and life.'
</p>

<p>
'I wish you would be a little more
considerate, and think of your old father at
times.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa!' she exclaimed, reproachfully,
and then she sighed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
'How often and how long, oh heaven! am
I to hear all this over and over again?'
</p>

<p>
'Here comes Cadbury to sit with me, I
suppose, so you may go to your own room,'
said Sir Ranald, as the suitor appeared at
the door in full evening costume prior to
sitting down to dinner, and she gladly
withdrew.
</p>

<p>
'Sir Ranald,' said he, in a low but excited
tone of voice, 'I have some news for you.'
</p>

<p>
Now my Lord Cadbury hated sickness,
suffering, death-beds, 'and all that sort of
thing,' and he had generally avoided Sir
Ranald just now, so the latter raised himself
on his elbow expectantly.
</p>

<p>
'News?' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;that fellow Goring is in Antwerp.'
</p>

<p>
'Goring!  How do you know?'
</p>

<p>
'Gaskins saw him on board my yacht,
where he actually had the insolence to
make some inquiries, but Gaskins is a trump,
and sent him on a wrong scent.'
</p>

<p>
He did not tell the story of this too
probable arrest, as the honourable spirit of Sir
Ranald Cheyne would never consent to
having a conspiracy of that kind hatched,
which might prove the utter destruction of
an innocent English gentleman, but he knit
his brows, and said,
</p>

<p>
'We must be careful now, and conceal
this circumstance from Alison.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course, and you must get well as
soon as you can, that we may decamp from
Antwerp.'
</p>

<p>
'Curse this Goring!' thought Sir Ranald.
'A fine fellow truly, who has only his
debts and liabilities, no doubt, to offer in
lieu of solid marriage settlements; but for
him and his mal-influence on that idiot girl,
through Cadbury, Essilmont, manor house,
tower, and fortalice, mains and acres might
yet all be mine, and my name not be erased
from the roll of country gentlemen in
Aberdeenshire!'
</p>

<p>
He sighed and moaned heavily, and Cadbury,
who was a bad hand at consolation or
sympathy, looked on with angry eyes and
knitted brow.
</p>

<p>
That Alison, with a will of her own,
should have a fancy for&mdash;even desire to
marry&mdash;the wrong man was, Sir Ranald at
times thought, natural enough, but that she
should fancy a 'beggarly fellow' like this
Goring, as he deemed him, was monstrous,
while Cadbury's wealth and rank were
thrown into the opposite scale!
</p>

<p>
So Cadbury soon withdrew, and Sir Ranald
was left to muse sadly and bitterly on
the perversity of his only child and the
prospects of his race.
</p>

<p>
He was the last baronet, he knew, of
Essilmont, and at his death the last rood
that remained to him there&mdash;the last of the
old, old heritage of his forefathers&mdash;would
pass with him, and what then would become
of Alison?  His proud, yet selfish and
affectionate, soul died within him at the
thought of her future, if she pursued her
present line of conduct.
</p>

<p>
Ranald was gone, and Ellon too.  He
must follow soon, and, even if he had his
wish, to him it seemed sad in his family
vanity that the world should be threatened
with the extinction of the good old name of
Cheyne of Essilmont, even though the last
of the line became Lady Cadbury.
</p>

<p>
'Cadbury&mdash;faugh&mdash;a <i>parvenu</i>?' was his
next peevish thought; 'and now here was
this fellow Bevil Goring on their trail, in
full search no doubt!' and he knew that
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'There never yet was human power<br>
  That could evade, if unforgiven,<br>
  The potent search and vigil long<br>
  Of him who treasures up a wrong.'<br>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
IN THE RUE DES BEGUINES.
</h3>

<p>
'Everyone has a romance in their
life,' Dalton had said to Goring one
day referring, no doubt, to the romance that
formed a part of his own; 'to some it comes
early, to others late.'
</p>

<p>
Goring thought of that remark when he
found that his abrupt visitor was an officer
of gendarmes come to arrest and carry him
before a magistrate.  For what?
</p>

<p>
Was this a bit of his romance, or a
disgusting reality?  We fear he found it the
latter eventually.
</p>

<p>
'For what am I wanted?' he asked, haughtily.
</p>

<p>
'You will learn that soon enough, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
'And to where must I accompany you?'
</p>

<p>
'To the police station&mdash;first.'
</p>

<p>
'First&mdash;and where afterwards?'
</p>

<p>
'That is as may be&mdash;but I have not come
here to answer your questions&mdash;especially if
asked in such a tone.'
</p>

<p>
'I am an officer in Her Britannic Majesty's
service.'
</p>

<p>
'Officers in Her Britannic Majesty's service
do not usually come to Belgium with
such papers as have been found among your
baggage.'
</p>

<p>
'The fellow is mad!' exclaimed Goring,
on which the gendarme uttered a growl and
struck the brass hilt of his sword
significantly with his left hand.
</p>

<p>
'If monsieur is a British officer perhaps
he has his cards about him?' he said, after a
little pause.
</p>

<p>
'Of course I have,' replied Goring, and
proceeded in haste to investigate, but in
vain, the pockets of his coat.
</p>

<p>
'The case is gone; I have dropped it
somehow,' he exclaimed, in perplexity and
confusion.
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' exclaimed the gendarme; 'I
thought so&mdash;come along; we are but
wasting time.'
</p>

<p>
A voiture was summoned.  A gendarme
mounted on the box beside the driver, other
two stepped inside with Goring, who, thus
escorted, was driven in silence through
several streets, just as the lamps were being
lighted, to a police station in a narrow alley,
near the Rempart Saint Catharine, where
he was conducted into a species of office,
over the mantelpiece of which were the
ancient arms of the city of Antwerp, like those
of Edinburgh, a castle triple-towered with
three banners, each bearing a human hand,
and there he found himself before a Juge
de Paix or Préfet he knew not which; but
a portly individual armed with considerable
authority, and determined apparently to use
it.
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose or reason am I
brought here, monsieur?' asked Goring,
haughtily and angrily.
</p>

<p>
The man in authority&mdash;the Préfet, we
shall call him&mdash;drew from his pocket a
bronze medal attached to a ribbon, and
shook it in his face, saying brusquely,
</p>

<p>
'I will teach you to know the Belgian
colours when you see them.  Gardez-vous!'
he added.
</p>

<p>
Goring was too much of a soldier and
gentleman to insult or resist any constituted
authority, and, believing the whole affair to
be, if not a joke, some explainable mistake,
waited the next move with patience.
</p>

<p>
A whispered conversation went on in
French between his captors and the Préfet,
who made several entries in a large book,
looking through his large, round spectacles
at their prisoner from time to time, and
then most severely at a little roll of printed
papers, which the officer of gendarmes laid
before him.
</p>

<p>
'What is all this about&mdash;what is the
meaning of this absurdity, this outrage?'
demanded Goring.
</p>

<p>
'No outrage at all,' replied the official,
knitting his brows.
</p>

<p>
'Why has my baggage been seized!'
</p>

<p>
'You will learn in good time.  <i>Sapristi</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Why not now?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, it contained what it should not.'
</p>

<p>
'My baggage?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'It was duly inspected by the <i>douanier</i> at
the quay and passed.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; your portmanteau, as he is here
ready to affirm,' replied the Préfet; 'but not
your roll of railway rugs?'
</p>

<p>
'And what the deuce was in it?'
</p>

<p>
'That which you were too cunning to
have in your portmanteau.'
</p>

<p>
'Too cunning to put in my portmanteau!'
said Goring, in utter bewilderment, and
almost inclined to laugh now.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sapristi</i>!' exclaimed the other, using that
exclamation which is for ever on a Belgian
tongue; 'don't repeat my words, insolent!
You concealed there these revolutionary
papers, the existence of which and your
object in coming to Belgium were duly and
fortunately reported to the police the
moment you stepped upon the Quai Van
Dyck.'
</p>

<p>
'My object&mdash;reported&mdash;and by whom?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not precisely know&mdash;one of your
countrymen, however; it was reported to
the gendarme on duty there, and the report
proved a true one.  Here is a roll of nearly
fifty circulars issued by the chiefs of the late
French Commune in three languages, one
of them being Flemish, inciting a rising
against kings and all constituted authorities,
which no doubt you intended to distribute
here in the cause of liberty, equality,
fraternity, and social democracy.'
</p>

<p>
Goring was so confounded by all this that
he remained for a moment or two silent,
and then he laughed heartily.
</p>

<p>
'You will find this no laughing matter&mdash;Sapristi?'
exclaimed the other, dipping a pen
in the ink-bottle.  'Your name, coquin?'
</p>

<p>
Goring's brow knit at this epithet; so he
replied sternly, giving his name and rank.
</p>

<p>
'Calls himself a British officer, does he?'
said the magistrate to the gendarmes, who
laughed at it as a joke.
</p>

<p>
'Were you ever in Belgium before?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'What is your profession or occupation?'
</p>

<p>
'I have already told you.'
</p>

<p>
'Are you married?'
</p>

<p>
'Really, monsieur, your questions border
on the impertinent.'
</p>

<p>
'You are an Englishman?'
</p>

<p>
'I am glad to say I am.'
</p>

<p>
'But well acquaint with Lester Squarr, I
doubt not, where all the foreign <i>canaille</i> do
congregate?'
</p>

<p>
'You are an insolent fool.'
</p>

<p>
'We shall teach you to play tricks in
Belgium, however.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n Belgium!' exclaimed Goring,
losing patience utterly at last.  'I wish it
was a few inches under the sea, instead
of being a few inches out of it.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>C'est excellent, c'est excellent!  Je déclare
qu'il est incorrigible.  Gendarmes, remenez-le
à Prison&mdash;Rue des Beguines</i>,' exclaimed the
Préfet, furiously.
</p>

<p>
'This is beyond a joke now, by Jove; it
is as well the mess don't know of it,' was
Goring's first thought.  'I should be quizzed
to death as the agitator of Republican
principles in Belgium.  And this cursed
confusion and detention will prevent me from
discovering Alison.'
</p>

<p>
He was now deprived of her ring, in spite
of all his protestations and supplications that
it might be left with him; his watch and
purse were also taken from him; but all
were carefully put past, however, and in a
few minutes more, escorted by gendarmes
with drawn swords, and followed by a
crowd of fellows in blue blouses and wooden
sabots, he was conducted past the church of
St. Augustine, in the Rue des Beguines, to
the great towering prison, the walls of which
overshadow the centre of the Rue des
Beguines; and there, after being formally
handed over to the care of the <i>concierge</i> in a
little chamber scantily furnished, with a
strongly grated window, he found himself
left to his own reflections.
</p>

<p>
Pride of his position as an English gentleman,
and as a British officer bearing the
Royal commission, rose in revolt in his
heart at the grotesque insult put upon him
through some extraordinary mistake; and
though he was conscious that the rascally
valet Gaskins had deceived him as to the
address of his master, and was aware that
the latter and Sir Ranald too would now be
put upon their guard and shift their quarters,
thus making approaches to Alison more difficult,
Goring never for a moment connected
him with his present predicament, the escape
from which, by some legal and constitutional
measure, would have to be seen to at once.
Doubtless with morning the whole folly
of the affair would be brought to light, and
in the meanwhile he could but resort to
patience, while the hours were chimed and
carillons rung in the adjacent church of
St. André, wherein a portrait of Mary Queen of
Scots now marks the grave of two English
ladies, her attendants, one of whom received
her last embrace previous to her execution.
</p>

<p>
He could also hear the artillery trumpets
sounding tattoo in the Caserne des Predicateurs,
and the sound made him think of the
merriment and luxury prevailing at that
very hour in the mess-room at Atdershot,
and of his regiment now far away on the
billow in the transport then steaming along
the western coast of Africa.
</p>

<p>
Then his adopted patience deserted him,
and he started to his feet, only to anathematise
the people of Antwerp generally, their
authorities in particular, and to seat himself
hopelessly again on a somewhat hard chair.
</p>

<p>
Morning came; the day passed on and
the evening also, and again he heard the
shrill trumpets pealing out tattoo in the
echoing square of the artillery barracks;
and many days and nights followed each
other, till he was well-nigh mad with
exasperation and anxiety, but no token came of
release or further examination.
</p>

<p>
If some absurd or misleading paragraph
appeared in the Belgian papers, and from
these found its way into the English journals,
what strange views of his predicament might
not be taken by his friends and the military
authorities at home!
</p>

<p>
But the Belgian police, like other similar
forces on the Continent, are very reticent
with reference to their own movements and
affairs; and, as yet, they prevented him from
communicating with our consul at Antwerp,
our ambassador at Brussels, or by letter
with his solicitors, Messrs. Taype, Shawrpe,
&amp; Scrawly, Gray's Inn Square, the presence
of one of whom in Antwerp might have
proved of vast service to him just then.
So the weary days passed on, and Bevil
Goring thought with truth that he would
have cause to remember long the bitter
coffee and onion soup&mdash;or <i>soupe-maigre</i>&mdash;and
the <i>Ratatouil</i>, Flemish for a ragout made
of scraps of meat, during his enforced abode
in the Rue des Beguines!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
ENNUI AND WEARINESS.
</h3>

<p>
But for her love for Bevil Goring, Alison
felt at times that she would have
sacrificed herself for her father.  Selfish and
coldly proud though his nature was, still he
was her father, and she was his last link to
earth&mdash;the last link of that long chain of
ancestors he prized so much, and who went
back to the years of the War of Independence,
and beyond them.
</p>

<p>
Yes&mdash;out of pity for him she might have
sacrificed herself to Cadbury; but now the
image of Bevil Goring rendered that
impossible, and even death itself preferable.
</p>

<p>
Poor girl! moped in that great dull hotel,
she wearied sorely.  Her father was kind to
her after a fashion of his own, but she longed
regretfully for the past time when she could
throw her arms around her mother's neck
and lay her head upon her breast&mdash;the panacea
for all young folks whose troubles seem
overwhelming; but what were the troubles
that beset her when that dear mother
was alive, compared with those that beset
her now?
</p>

<p>
And with regard to these, she knew what
that mother's advice would have been:&mdash;'Better
is a dinner of herbs where love is,
than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.'
</p>

<p>
My Lord Cadbury was rather tiring, or
getting exasperated by the slow success of
his love affair, and was beginning to think
seriously of how he would separate Alison
from her 'bore of a father,' and get her
alone with him, perhaps to Brussels, where
his rascal Gaskins would easily procure him
apartments.
</p>

<p>
For some time past his lordship had cunningly
dropped the <i>rôle</i> of lover and adopted
that of friend, perhaps to throw Alison off
her guard, and as he did not&mdash;as some old
fellows do&mdash;act 'the paternal' part, to a
certain extent she became so, and her normal
state or feeling of defiance and dislike was
dulled for a time.
</p>

<p>
Thus her face looked calm and placid,
with a curiously pathetic expression, and
her eyes had at times a far-away look in
them that gave Sir Ranald a strange dull
pain in his heart, especially one evening,
when, taking grapes one by one from a
plate of painted Antwerp china-ware, she
fed him playfully as a nurse might a child.
</p>

<p>
'Bird Ailie,' said he, 'my dear bird Ailie.'
</p>

<p>
He saw how her hand looked quite transparent,
and a pang of dismay smote his heart.
</p>

<p>
'You are not well, darling,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes, papa,' she replied, with affected
cheerfulness, 'I am very well; but oh, if
we were only home again out of this foggy
Antwerp.  I think I could wheel you about
in a bath chair as well as old Archie, were
we only home to&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Where?</i>' he asked, sharply.  'But I must
take care of you now for my own sake.
This confinement is killing you; go out
somewhere, anywhere under Cadbury's
escort.'
</p>

<p>
But Alison shook her head.  As yet she
had seen nothing of the famous city of
Antwerp, though she could not look forth from
her windows in the quaint Place Verte, or
along the Marché aux Souliers, with all its
shops, without a longing to explore, everything
seemed so strange, so striking; for, as
Sir Walter Scott wrote truthfully and
graphically, 'it is in the streets of Antwerp
and Brussels that the eye rests upon the
forms of architecture which appear in the
pictures of the Flemish school&mdash;those fronts
richly decorated with various ornaments,
and terminating in roofs, the slope of which
is concealed from the eye by windows and
gables still more highly ornamented; the
whole comprising a general effect which,
from its grandeur and intricacy, at once
amuses and delights the spectator.  In fact,
this rich intermixture of towers and battlements
and projecting windows, highly sculptured,
joined to the height of the houses
and the variety of ornaments upon their
fronts, produce an effect as superior to those
of the tame uniformity of a modern street
as the casque of a warrior exhibits over the
slouched, broad-brimmed beaver of a
Quaker.'
</p>

<p>
Another remarkable feature in the Belgian
streets is the enormous height of the
front doors, with rings and knockers of brass
often more than a foot in diameter.
</p>

<p>
Lord Cadbury had received a card of
invitation <i>pour milord et ses dames</i> to a <i>Redoute
monstre et fête de nuit</i> at the Théâtre des
Variétés, where there was to be a species
of <i>bal masqué</i> in the great saloon, and on
the stage a 'Kermesse Flamande, Fête
Venitienne,' as it was announced, and he
treated Sir Ranald's permission to take
Alison with him, simply as a spectator in
her street costume.
</p>

<p>
All the ladies who dance at these balls
wear masques and black silk dominoes over
their ball dresses; the gentlemen are in
evening dress, and do not wear masks, as
he explained to her, and Alison, <i>ennuyed</i>
and weary of confinement and dulness,
consented to go, at her father's urgent request,
though she was without a chaperon; but
then, as the former said, no one knew her
in Antwerp.
</p>

<p>
When Alison thought of Lord Cadbury's
wishes and proposals as regarded herself,
she felt that she ought not to accompany
him to this fête, but her love for Bevil
seemed to guard her like a suit of armour;
the temptation to see a little of outdoor life
prevailed, and so she yielded, but not
without dread and reluctance.  Was this a
prevision of what was to come?
</p>

<p>
That morning she had been at a well-known
<i>coiffeur's</i> getting her hair dressed,
and was rather scared than amused to see
gentlemen and ladies seated side by side
in the saloon, under the hands of his
assistants, the former getting their beards
shaved and moustaches trimmed, and the
latter their back hair brushed and dressed:
but, though this was only a specimen of the
freedom of Belgian life, young ladies, she
knew, could not go abroad without a
chaperon; but then, Lord Cadbury, she
reflected, was old enough to be her father.
</p>

<p>
He would take the greatest care of her&mdash;the
scene would be a brilliant one, and one,
moreover, entirely new to her.
</p>

<p>
'And I am not to go in costume, or wear
a domino?' said Alison, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;as a spectator only&mdash;your hat and
sealskin jacket, of course; but we shall
see the dancers from the promenade round
the saloon, and the Flemish scene on the
stage about half-past ten.'
</p>

<p>
'Can you spare me, papa?' she asked, softly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, darling, go,' he replied, weakly but
earnestly.
</p>

<p>
So a voiture was summoned, and Alison
departed, after dinner, escorted by Lord
Cadbury.  Through the broad and spacious
Rue de l'Hôpital and Rue Grande, with its
quaint old houses, to the private entrance of
the Théâtre des Variétés in the Rue des
Escrimeurs, a narrow street, and never in
all her future life did she repent of any
action more bitterly.
</p>

<p>
The brief change of scene or action
would draw her from herself, as she had
been afflicted with severe distracting
thoughts of late.
</p>

<p>
Had Bevil gone to the seat of war, or
was he still in England?  She was as
ignorant of his movements as he nearly was
of hers; but it was too probably the former,
and she supposed he would soon be face
to face with danger and death.  Her
absence&mdash;her flight it would seem&mdash;from Chilcote,
she supposed, must be all unexplained to
him, and, if explained, he would learn that
she was with Lord Cadbury; and, after all
he knew, what might he not fear and <i>think</i>?
</p>

<p>
Think that which might lead him to believe
she was untrue, and leave him to be
happy yet with some <i>other</i> girl, who might
love him as she now loved him, and as
he wished to be loved.
</p>

<p>
And more keenly did these thoughts distract
her mind after the&mdash;to her&mdash;fatal
night of the <i>bal masqué</i>.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
LE REDOUTE MONSTRE.
</h3>

<p>
Alison found herself in a great oblong
saloon, brilliantly lighted by crystal
gaseliers, decorated by lofty mirrors,
surrounded by a colonnade of elegant pillars
and overlooked by a balustraded orchestra
occupied by the fine band of the Garde
Municipale.  The centre of this saloon, the
floor of which was carefully waxed, was
specially reserved for dancers; but a
platform on four sides of it, and without the
lines of pillars, was occupied by promenaders,
for whom there were seats and
lounges.
</p>

<p>
One end was closed by the proscenium
and green curtain of the Théâtre des
Variétés.
</p>

<p>
The majority of the male dancers were
in evening costume, though a few wore
fancy dresses, and there were spider-waisted
Belgian officers from the adjacent Caserne
St. Georges, with loose gold epaulets, dark
blue tunics, and baggy light grey pantaloons.
</p>

<p>
Many of the ladies were in fancy costume&mdash;some
a little <i>prononcé</i>, being almost that
of the Corps de Ballet, though their dresses
were often trimmed with rich, old,
coffee-coloured Flemish lace; but the majority
wore dominoes of black satin or silk, and
all had black velvet masks and thin black
lace veils, or head-dresses, like the Spanish
mantilla, so commonly worn by the women
in some parts of Belgium&mdash;a relic of the
days of the Duke of Alva&mdash;the 'Castigator
de los Flamencos.'
</p>

<p>
Many were hovering about in corners,
or near certain pillars, evidently waiting to
keep appointments made elsewhere with
those who would recognise them&mdash;though
masked to the upper lip&mdash;by a particular
flower worn in the breast, by the rosettes
on their white kid boots, a little patch on
the chin, or so forth; and while the round
dances&mdash;waltzes, polkas, and mazurka&mdash;were
in progress, Alison, to whom the scene
was entirely new, watched the lovers&mdash;for
such she supposed they must be, and no
doubt many were&mdash;and, with an interest in
which her own heart shared, saw many a
glad meeting, a smile, a pressure of the
hand interchanged; and then by tacit
consent they whirled into the gay and
fast-increasing throng, while overhead the music
of Straus or Chopin came pealing from the
lofty orchestra.
</p>

<p>
Alison felt her little feet beating time to
the music, the 'Soldatenlieder' of Herr
Gung'l, 'Je t'aime' of Waldteufel, and so
forth.  How she longed, sealskin jacket
and all, to join in the then delicious waltzes!
She was very young, and life would indeed
be wretched were it a blank at her years.
The whole scene was a novel and brilliant
one; most strange to her eyes, and, if her
situation was an anxious one in Antwerp, it
was not without its sad romance; but for a
time, as she looked around her, she forgot
even that, or was only recalled to it when
Lord Cadbury addressed her.
</p>

<p>
And, meanwhile, the parvenu peer,
pleased with the delicate beauty of his
companion, in whose pale cheeks a little
rose-leaf tint now came, with a sparkle in
her usually quiet eyes, felt very vain of the
handsome girl who leant on his arm, and
attracted the admiration of many a passing
and many a lingering man, who hovered
near to admire her.
</p>

<p>
Among these were two Englishmen, Sir
Jasper Dehorsey (a sporting baronet) and
his friend, Mr. Tom Hawksleigh, also
well-known, and not very reputably, on various
racecourses.  They seemed to know no one
there, and were mere spectators, though
doubtless amid that vast throng they might
have introduced themselves to some of the
fair dominoes without being severely repulsed.
</p>

<p>
Both were in full evening-dress, with
loose, light dust coat worn open, and crush
hat under the arm; both were gentlemanly
in bearing and appearance, and their faces
would have been good but for the sinister,
rakish, and <i>blasé</i> expression of their eyes,
and the sensual and sneering curve of their
lips.  Sir Jasper, the taller of the two by
half a head, stuck his glass in his right eye,
and said,
</p>

<p>
'Tom, look at that girl with the blue
velvet hat; she is English&mdash;I'll swear she is.'
</p>

<p>
'And a regular beauty, by Jove!'
</p>

<p>
'Doocid curious place for her to be, this.
She is all right, I suppose; what do you
think?'
</p>

<p>
'I think it doubtful&mdash;hails from the latitude
of Regent Street, I should say,' replied
the other, who thought evil of everyone and
everything.
</p>

<p>
'Who is that <i>moyen-âge</i> individual with
the white horse-shoe shaped moustache and
coarse ears, who seems to regard her with
such a proprietary air?'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, it is old Cadbury!' exclaimed
Mr. Hawksleigh.
</p>

<p>
'Cadbury&mdash;it is!' added the baronet;
'the little party can't be particular to a
shade if she is with <i>him</i>.  She'll not set
much store on the whole duty of woman.'
</p>

<p>
'What is that?' asked Hawksleigh.
</p>

<p>
'Why, to get married&mdash;to get well married,
if possible, but anyhow, to get married
on any terms.'
</p>

<p>
'He is a lord; but a silk purse can't be
made out of a sow's ear.'
</p>

<p>
'I am too poor a devil just now to sneer
at his money or position, or, by Jove, I
would do so at both.  His father was
"something" in the city, whatever that
means.  Let us take the girl from him.'
</p>

<p>
'All right&mdash;I am your man,' exclaimed
Hawksleigh.
</p>

<p>
'He doesn't seem to have even an old
woman to play propriety or act chaperon.'
</p>

<p>
'When did he ever study Mrs. Grundy?
But to see such a girl as this with him
reminds me of Beauty and the Beast.'
</p>

<p>
'Her wisdom is no doubt in her dressing-case,
and her modesty&mdash;well, ah&mdash;in her
pocket, I suppose.  Well, here goes&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Stop, don't be too hasty.  Ah! the old
rip, he doesn't care about acting lotus-eater
at Cadbury Court, and so has come abroad
with "somebody's luggage."  <i>Who</i> can the
little girl be?'
</p>

<p>
'Not much, when she is with him, as I
said before,' responded the <i>blasé</i> baronet.
'We'll soon find out.  Like the conspirators
in a burlesque, who turn up the collars of
their coats, we must say, "Let us dissemble!"'
</p>

<p>
What their precise plans were they perhaps
scarcely knew, but half-past ten was
announced as the time when, as the
programme had it, the curtain was to rise on
the <i>Rideau de Séparation de la Scène, et
commencement de la Kermesse</i>, when the stage
appeared with a landscape and busy groups
in peasant costume, showing the whole
business of a Flemish fair; the dancing
ceased, and an immediate rush towards the
proscenium took place from all parts of the
saloon, the refreshment-rooms, and adjacent
passages.
</p>

<p>
The Belgians are not famous for their
politeness, and many of those present on
this occasion were of the bourgeois class;
thus when the curtain rose there was
instantly a rough, unceremonious, and furious
crowding towards the proscenium, and in
the crush the hand of Alison was torn from
the arm of Cadbury, and they were
hopelessly separated by a crowd of more than a
thousand persons, tightly wedged together.
</p>

<p>
So far were they apart that he totally
failed to see anything of her or where she
was, and nearly an hour elapsed before the
follies of the Kermesse were over, and a
resumption of the dancing dispersed the
crowd about the greater space of the saloon.
Immediately on this taking place, Cadbury
began a search on every hand, amid all the
groups and in all the adjacent rooms and
corridors&mdash;even between the wings of the
now open stage&mdash;for Alison, but she was
nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
He questioned the waiters, the door-keeper,
and other officials, but none had
seen any lady, who answered to the
description given, leave the hall.
</p>

<p>
Midnight was past now, and as the <i>bal
masqué</i> would last till four in the morning
hundreds of more ticket-holders came crowding
in, and Cadbury became at last convinced&mdash;and
with no small alarm&mdash;that Alison must
have quitted the place, and missing him, or
indifferent as to what he might think, had
got a voiture and driven home to their hotel.
</p>

<p>
When he quitted the theatre and got a similar
vehicle snow was falling heavily, and when
he reached the Hôtel St. Antoine great was
his alarm and dismay to find from the
<i>concierge</i> and waiters that she had not returned!
</p>

<p>
Not returned&mdash;snow falling and the
cathedral bell tolling one in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Her room was searched; she was evidently
not there&mdash;not with her father or in
any part of the house.  No doubt remained
of that.
</p>

<p>
With all his selfishness, Cadbury was
dismayed and enraged.  Where was she&mdash;with
whom?
</p>

<p>
The snow was still falling, and the storm
showed no sign of abatement.  The vast
space of the Place Verte was one sheet of
white, across which the lights from the
hotel windows and the street lamps cast
long lines of radiance, and high in the tall
spire jangled the merry carillons.
</p>

<p>
'Out in a night like this&mdash;in a foreign
city, more than half the inhabitants of
which speak nothing but Flemish, where can
she be?' he thought.  'Why does she not
make an effort to get back to the hotel?'
</p>

<p>
He drove back to the Théâtre des
Variétés, where the music and the dancing were
still in full progress, to repeat his inquiries in
vain; when morning dawned the snow had
ceased, but there was no appearance of Alison.
</p>

<p>
'This will kill her father!' was now
Cadbury's thought.
</p>

<p>
Had an accident befallen her?  With
earliest dawn he had messengers despatched
to all the hospitals and gendarme stations,
but in vain.  No accident had happened,
nor had anyone answering to the description
of Alison been seen.
</p>

<p>
Her absence could no longer be concealed
from her horrified father, who at once
concluded that she must have eloped with
Goring, of whose predicament and whereabouts
Cadbury had kept him ignorant, so
he was not ill-pleased to let him think so.
</p>

<p>
Rage at the adventurer, as he deemed
Goring, acted like a spur on Sir Ranald.
He left his sick couch and seemed to make
a struggle to get well that he might join in
the search and trace <i>them</i> out.
</p>

<p>
Cadbury had not been without daring
ideas of luring Alison away from Sir Ranald
and compromising her; but now she was
he knew not where, and in the hands of a
man perhaps more unscrupulous than himself!
</p>

<p>
His memory was now full of the hundred
terrible stories he had read in the public
prints of English girls entrapped to Belgium
and never heard of again, and, though his
mind was always prone to evil, he was
exasperated as well as dismayed when days
passed and no tidings were heard of the
lost one.
</p>

<p>
It was winter in earnest now.  The banks
of the Scheldt were fringed by masses of
ice, and ice covered all the great bassins of
Antwerp, while stainless snow shrouded all
the surrounding country, and the stone
Madonnas at the street corners had a chill and
deadly aspect, for it was weather to make
hands blue and noses red, as the frost was
keen and strong.
</p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
THE CAFE AU PROGRES.
</h3>

<p>
The two Englishmen to whom we have
referred&mdash;Sir Jasper Dehorsey and
Mr. Tom Hawksleigh&mdash;saw how Cadbury
and Alison were for the time hopelessly
separated by the pleasure-seeking crowd,
and hastened at once to improve the
occasion by taking advantage of the confusion
and of her excessive dismay.
</p>

<p>
After a word or two of hasty instructions
whispered to his friend, Sir Jasper
approached Alison, and said, with a profound
bow,
</p>

<p>
'They are rather <i>sans cérémonie</i> here, but
don't be alarmed.  I shall take care of you.
Trust to me, and permit me,' he added,
drawing her little hand over his left arm,
and leading her away in a direction opposite
to where he knew Cadbury was doing his
utmost to get free of the crowd.  'Do not
be alarmed,' he resumed, 'we shall soon
restore you to your friend.'
</p>

<p>
He spoke most suavely, as though he was,
what he wished her to think him&mdash;a chivalrous
and gallant protector, and, sooth to
say, Alison was glad to hear an English
voice, and to see some one who appeared
like an English gentleman, and, externally,
Sir Jasper certainly was one.
</p>

<p>
'This way, please; let me draw you out
of the crowd,' said he, guiding her towards
one of the saloon doors.
</p>

<p>
'How rude&mdash;how rough the people are,'
exclaimed Alison, with reference to the
crowd that separated her from Lord
Cadbury, of whom she could see nothing now,
and the hubbub of the <i>kermesse</i> on the stage
was stunning.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said Sir Jasper, with a lazy smile,
'they are not the <i>crème de la crème</i> of
Antwerp, nor <i>crème</i> of any kind; and, truth to
tell, I was surprised to see you here.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!' exclaimed Alison, with annoyance
at having been lured, as she certainly
was, into a false position.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Mr. Hawksleigh, who
had been in the corridor, came to say that
Lord Cadbury, being unable to find the
young lady, had gone to the Café or
Restaurant au Progrès.
</p>

<p>
'Without me!' exclaimed Alison.
</p>

<p>
'His lordship felt faint, and awaits you there.'
</p>

<p>
'Did he say so?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' was the reply of the unblushing
Mr. Tom Hawksleigh.
</p>

<p>
'Most strange!'
</p>

<p>
'Shall we not follow him?' urged Sir
Jasper, with his blandest tone.
</p>

<p>
'I ought to go home to the Hôtel St. Antoine,'
said Alison, with doubt now added
to her dismay.
</p>

<p>
'You can't do that alone.  The Restaurant
au Progrès is close by&mdash;almost a part
of the theatre&mdash;and if Lord Cadbury is
unwell&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Then let us go instantly, please.'
</p>

<p>
He led her at once from the hall and
down the staircase, up which fresh groups&mdash;men
in evening dress and ladies in masks
and dominoes&mdash;were crowding, all laughing
and joyous, and thence into the Rue des
Escrimeurs, where they crossed the street,
and entered a brilliantly lighted café; but
avoiding the great pillared dining or supper
hall, which was fitted up with marble tables,
crowded with guests (many of them masked
dominoes), he led her upstairs to a private
supper-room, preceded by a waiter, to whom
he gave some instructions rapidly in French.
</p>

<p>
Where was Lord Cadbury, he inquired.
</p>

<p>
The waiter did not know.  Among the
many now in the cafè, milord might be one;
but he would inquire.  Meantime, what did
monsieur wish for supper.
</p>

<p>
In the fair cheek of Alison the delicate
colour came and went, and in her eyes
there was a strange look of inquiry as she
glanced from one man to the other, ignorant
that in an instant there was a secret
understanding between them, and that the
Belgian <i>valet de cabaret</i> took in the whole
situation at once.
</p>

<p>
'Supper&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>à la carte</i>&mdash;salmi of guinea
fowl, Ris d'Agneau, sauce champignon, and
some Moselle.  Meantime, ask for his lordship.'
</p>

<p>
The waiter grinned in what Alison thought
a disagreeable manner, and disappeared
with his towel over his arm.
</p>

<p>
The decorations of the little room were
very handsome.  The hangings were of
blue silk, the floor was polished oak, and
the chairs were all lounges of blue velvet,
but some of the statuettes on brackets and
consoles were, to say the least of them, a
little startling in design.
</p>

<p>
'This is a very strange place,' said Alison.
'I cannot imagine what induced Lord Cadbury
to select it.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you been in this part of the world
long?' asked Sir Jasper, as he divested
himself of his light dust-coat.
</p>

<p>
'A few weeks&mdash;I was about to say years.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor girl!  Has the time been so slow?'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said Alison, haughtily, as she
disliked his pitying tone, 'I have the old and
ailing&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Cadbury to nurse&mdash;surely not?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not, sir.  How could you
suppose that?'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me.'
</p>

<p>
Proud as Lucifer with all her sweetness,
thought Sir Jasper, as Alison bowed haughtily,
but no smile spread over the regular
contour of her face.
</p>

<p>
'We have met before&mdash;at least, I remember
now to have had the pleasure of seeing
you,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'When?'
</p>

<p>
'This very day.'
</p>

<p>
'But where?'
</p>

<p>
'At the coiffeur's in the Rue des Tanneurs.
I sat beside you, and saw your hair dressed,
and lovely hair it is!'
</p>

<p>
'You sat beside me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and watched you.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?
</p>

<p>
'I ought to apologise for making a lady's
face a study; but need I say how deeply
yours interested me?'
</p>

<p>
He was bending over her chair now in
perfect confidence.  He thought he had her
in his power, and felt
</p>

<p>
  'How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds<br>
  Makes ill deeds done.'<br>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Not that he thought there was much
harm in 'levanting with old Cadbury's girl;'
it seemed rather a joke, in fact!
</p>

<p>
'Won't you take off your hat and sealskin
before Lord Cadbury comes?' he urged, in
a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;excuse me; and I shall not take
them off after he does come.'
</p>

<p>
'Why so?  Will you sup with them on?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;or I don't want supper at all.'
</p>

<p>
'A deuced decided little party,' thought
Sir Jasper, who never took his <i>blasé</i> eyes off
her.
</p>

<p>
'Where can Lord Cadbury be?' she
exclaimed, impatiently, after the waiter had
gone twice in search of him in vain.
</p>

<p>
'Can't say for the life of me; are you
anxious about him or yourself?'
</p>

<p>
'Myself, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, be assured I shall take the greatest
care of you,' said Sir Jasper, noting
with delight how perfect was the contour
of her face, the form of her hands and ears.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks; but this situation is intolerable&mdash;he
ought to be here.'
</p>

<p>
'I wonder he doesn't look better after his
property.'
</p>

<p>
'What <i>do</i> you mean?' asked Alison, at
this impudent remark.  'I am not his
property.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;a relation, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Not even a relation.'
</p>

<p>
'And you came to Antwerp some weeks ago?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'From Paris?'
</p>

<p>
'No; from Southampton in his yacht.'
</p>

<p>
'In his yacht&mdash;oh, by Jove! what other
ladies were of his party?' asked Sir Jasper,
quizzically, while stroking his tawny moustache.
</p>

<p>
'No lady but me.'
</p>

<p>
'In&mdash;deed!'
</p>

<p>
There was profound insolence in his
drawl, yet Alison never suspected it.
</p>

<p>
Sir Jasper Dehorsey now believed that
he might be as impudent as he chose; but
the girl's manner nevertheless bewildered
him.
</p>

<p>
'Why, sir, do you stare at me so?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'May I not look at you?'
</p>

<p>
'Not as you do,' she replied, with
hauteur.
</p>

<p>
'You grudge me that pleasure?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand all this!' she
exclaimed, as she started from her chair and
felt a difficulty in restraining her tears.
</p>

<p>
'Do be seated.  If Cadbury does not
appear in five minutes, I shall go in search
of him.'
</p>

<p>
'Or kindly get me a voiture to the Hôtel
St. Antoine.'
</p>

<p>
'So it is there they hang out,' thought he.
'Do you often go to the theatre?'
</p>

<p>
'Not now.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, you should see Antwerp when it is
<i>en fête</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'When is that?'
</p>

<p>
'In the carnival time.'  Then he continued,
'And how do you like this city by the
Scheldt?'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all,' she replied, curtly.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!  You have been at the opera,
of course?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Or the picture galleries?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'What!  Have you not seen the Royal
Museum, the antiquities at the Steyne, and
the Musée Plantin-Moretus?'
</p>

<p>
'I have seen none of those things.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor the splendid churches, and all the
rest of it?'
</p>

<p>
'I have been nowhere,' replied Alison,
thinking sadly of her father's sick-bed.
</p>

<p>
'How this old snake has kept this lovely
girl all to himself!' was the thought of Sir
Jasper, in whose heart envy now mingled
with exultation.
</p>

<p>
'How I should like to show you all
these places, and Brussels too!' said he at
length.
</p>

<p>
'I have often heard of the Musée Plantin,
with its quaint old rococo furniture and
antique pictures&mdash;the old-world air of the
place&mdash;its stillness and gloomy seclusion,'
said Alison.
</p>

<p>
'It is doocid slow.  Still I should like to
have the pleasure of showing it to you,' said
he again, stooping over her chair, but seeking
even then to throw her off her guard.
'The place itself is rather dark and gloomy
with its high wainscots, oak carvings, ebony
and ivory cabinets, faded tapestries,
casement windows, and all the rest of it&mdash;said
to be haunted by the ghosts of the funny
old printers who lived there and printed the
first Bible with old types which are yet
there, and which it is said they come once
a year at midnight to set up again, for the
creak of the ancient presses is heard.  But,
be all that as it may, I don't know a more
stunning place for a steady spoon or
flirtation than the solemn old quadrangular
Musée Plantin, with its suites of antique
rooms, furnished with cushioned lounges,
heavy curtains, and beds like tombs&mdash;like
plumed hearses, or the old state-beds in
Hampton Court&mdash;beds in which the dead
Plantins slept three hundred years ago.  By
Jove, you must let me show you all that
to-morrow.  But as that duffer, old
Cadbury, is so doocid long, had we not better
have supper without him?  Shall I order
the waiter to serve it up?' he added, laying
his hand upon the bell rope, as if her assent
would follow of course.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no&mdash;no,' exclaimed Alison, starting
from her seat now in positive alarm at the
idea of supping alone with a man whose
name was unknown to her, and in whose
watery, wicked eyes she was convinced there
was an expression now there could be no
mistaking.
</p>

<p>
'A glass of wine, then,' he urged, suavely.
</p>

<p>
'You must excuse me.'
</p>

<p>
'How shy you are!  I can never imagine
why any woman who is young and handsome
need be shy.'
</p>

<p>
'You know Lord Cadbury, of course,' said
Alison, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
'Intimately.'
</p>

<p>
'May I ask your name?'
</p>

<p>
'Captain Smith,' he replied, without a
moment's hesitation.  'The world says queer
things of old Cadbury.'
</p>

<p>
'What do people say?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, people, of course, say anything but
their prayers.  So rough things are said of
Old Cad., as he is called.  But never mind
him; let us talk of ourselves, and don't look
so uneasy.  I assure you I am a perfect
archangel of virtue, and have always
laughed at love at first sight till&mdash;<i>now</i>,' he
said, in a manner so pointed that it made
Alison's usually pale cheek flame.  'What
a deliciously fresh, unconventional, and
lovely little darling you are!' he exclaimed,
laying a hand upon her arm.
</p>

<p>
'Sir!'
</p>

<p>
'Hoity-toity.  Come, it mustn't give
itself little airs.  Look at that pretty
picture.
</p>

<p>
She gave it a glance.  It was the production,
doubtless, of some Parisian artist,
and the subject made her tremble with fear
and just anger.
</p>

<p>
She felt herself deeply insulted, and was
now convinced that she had been ensnared.
The blood of a hundred gallant Cheynes
welled up in her heart, yet there was an
expression of agony in her blue-grey eyes and
on her blanched and quivering lips.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the room door opened,
and the waiter appeared with the supper
tray.  She formed her resolution quick as
lightning, and acted upon it quite as quickly.
Young, active, and half wild with terror,
she darted from the room, nearly knocking
over Mr. Tom Hawksleigh, who was coming
to enjoy his share of the little supper
ordered by Sir Jasper, then down the staircase
of the café, and out into the darkened
streets, through which she fled like a hunted
hare; she knew not in what direction, nor
did she care, provided that she was not
overtaken by 'Captain Smith' or his
companion.
</p>

<p>
At that hour the streets of Antwerp are
usually deserted by all save the gendarmes,
and she had fled a considerable distance,
conscious only that the snow was falling fast,
before she stopped, quite out of breath, and
began to think by what means she could
reach the Hôtel St. Antoine, or get a
voiture to convey her there.
</p>

<p>
She had run to the end of the Rue des
Arquebusiers, and now before her opened
on either hand the long and spacious street
called the Place de Mer in which the
stately house of Rubens and the royal
palace stand side by side.
</p>

<p>
Not a cab was to be seen, nor a gendarme;
the wind was keen, the snow falling
heavily, and, like 'Policeman X' and other
guardians of the night, the gendarmes had
betaken themselves to some cosy estaminet,
or sought the hospitality of friendly kitchens
and confiding cookmaids.
</p>

<p>
Which way was she to turn? where seek
aid or shelter?  She closed her little hands
in terror and dismay, and, while shuddering
with cold, suddenly a chorus burst upon her
ear, and, before she could think which way
to turn, a dozen of great fellows in kepis,
blouses, and sabots, fresh from some
estaminet, surrounded her, with shouts and
mockery.
</p>

<p>
One put an arm round her and tried to
kiss her, tearing away her veil; but endued
with strength beyond herself, by the
extremity of her terror, she dashed him back
with both her hands.
</p>

<p>
'God help me!' she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
And hemming her in by a ring, they
danced round her hand in hand, singing a
song, which, as it was in Flemish and
unknown to her, she supposed was something
very ribald and horrible, yet it was only
thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Hark to the sound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fiddle and horn,<br>
  The dance and the song&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis a festal morn.<br>
  Oh! little they reck of dull care<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or of sorrow;<br>
  They laugh for the day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they weep on the morrow.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'Ouf!' shouted one, 'that would make a
grand pendant to the <i>Zeike Jongeling</i>,'
referring to Jan Van Beers, the greatest lyric
poet of the day.
</p>

<p>
'Une blonde English mees&mdash;une nymphe&mdash;<i>parbleu</i>!'
cried one fellow.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sommes-nous fantastiques!  N'est-elle pas
jolie</i>! ('Isn't she pretty!') cried another.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sur mon honneur, ma belle coquette!</i>' cried
a third, making a clutch at her.
</p>

<p>
Others shouted strange things in Flemish,
showing that they were boors or artizans,
redolent of garlic, beer, and tobacco; but
with a gasping sob of terror she broke away
from them and fled again.  She heard the
clatter of sabots behind her, as some started
in pursuit; but she was too swift for them,
and the sound soon died away in the distance.
</p>

<p>
Along the dark and now silent streets
she ran, close past the great doors of
innumerable houses, as there are no areas or
front garden plots in Antwerp, where the
entrances open directly off the footpaths.
Many a bell-handle and many a large
knocker&mdash;lion's heads and bull's heads as
large as life&mdash;were within her reach; but,
fearing to be roughly or coarsely repulsed,
she dared touch neither.
</p>

<p>
She passed a church of vast height and
colossal proportions&mdash;St. Jacques, though
she knew it not&mdash;where Rubens lies under
a slab of spotless white marble.  There
were few lamps in the streets in this
quarter, and the oil lanterns before the
Madonnas perched on stone brackets at the
street corners, swung dimly and mournfully
to and fro in the sleety and snowy wind.
</p>

<p>
She felt an apparently mortal chill in her
heart; her whole clothes were now soaked
with sleet by her falling once or twice as
she slipped.
</p>

<p>
Again she heard a tipsy chorus ringing
out upon the night, and, in terror lest she
was about to be overtaken by the roysterers
from whom she had escaped, on finding
herself near a great doorway in the Rue
Rouge, as it eventually proved to be, she
grasped the swinging handle of a bell and
pulled it violently.  She heard the sound
of the bell respond at a distance, and,
incapable of further endurance, before the door,
which was a double one of great size, was
opened, she had sunk down senseless, and
lay huddled in a kind of heap upon the
step of the house.
</p>

<p>
The last thing of which she was conscious
was feeling the hand of a man roughly and
daringly searching her pockets, as he
muttered, with an oath,
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sacré</i>! not a <i>sou</i>&mdash;not a <i>centime</i>!'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
CROSS PURPOSES.
</h3>

<p>
The morning was a clear, bright, sunny,
and joyous one, the sun without
cloud, the chimneys of Antwerp, as usual,
without smoke, though the season was
winter, and all its spires and countless
crow-stepped gables were standing up clearly
defined against a pure blue sky, when Bevil
Goring, with high spirits, yet not without
just emotions of great indignation, walked
forth a free man from the place in which
he had been detained, and, stepping into a
voiture with his luggage, told the driver to
take him to the Hôtel du Parc in the Place
Verte, and kissed the ring of Alison which
was on his finger again.  He was free, and
it had come about thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The papers and manifestoes found among
his property were of so serious and
compromising a nature that he was on the point
of being transmitted with them to Brussels,
but he contrived to employ an <i>advokat</i> (as
an attorney or barrister is called there) in
the Rue de l'Hôpital, who soon traced to
the arrested Belgian workman those
unlucky papers, and it chanced, oddly enough,
that the mischievous Mr. Gaskins, having
got a serious smash up in an accident on the
railway to Waterloo, believing himself to be
dying, made a full confession of the trick
he had played to serve a lucrative master;
and the Belgian authorities, duly aware at
last of Goring's rank and position in society,
confessed their haste and mistake, and, with a
'million pardons,' released him from an arrest
that, after it had extended to some days,
was nearly making him frantic, and he was
welcomed and ushered to his former
apartment at the hotel by the waiter Jacquot,
though Maître Jean Picot, remembering his
arrest, had some unpleasant doubts about
receiving him.
</p>

<p>
Bevil, however, lost no time in repairing
to the Hôtel St. Antoine, resolved to see
Sir Ranald&mdash;Alison too, if possible, if it was
not too late; but he was rather unprepared
for the state of affairs that awaited him
there.
</p>

<p>
Meeting the concierge or hall-porter at
the door, he asked with some anxiety if
Sir Ranald Cheyne was still there.
</p>

<p>
'Oui, monsieur,' replied the porter,
saluting in military fashion.
</p>

<p>
'And Miss Cheyne?'
</p>

<p>
'Non, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
The reply sank deep in Goring's heart,
and he was perplexed when the official at
the same time mysteriously shook his head
and shrugged his shoulders with a
deprecatory expression in his face.
</p>

<p>
'Is Lord Cadbury here?'
</p>

<p>
'Milord is out also,' was the reply.
</p>

<p>
'Also&mdash;then they are together!' thought
Goring.  'Take up my card to Sir Ranald,
and ask if he will receive me.'
</p>

<p>
It was taken up by a waiter, who returned
promptly to report, in Continental
parlance, that 'Sir Cheyne desired him to
walk up.'
</p>

<p>
Much depended upon the issue of this
visit if Alison was still free.  He had come
frankly, freely, to urge humbly his suit
again, backed by the undoubted wealth
which had flowed upon him since last they
met at Chilcote.
</p>

<p>
He found Sir Ranald in a handsome
apartment, seated in an easy-chair, but
looking pale, thin, and worn.  He made no
offer of his hand, as with both he grasped
the arms of the chair, tremulous with rage,
while his eyes glared like those of a rattlesnake
through the glasses of his <i>pince-nez</i> at
his unexpected visitor, who scarcely knew
how or where to begin, and looked
nervously round him for some evidence of the
recent presence of Alison, but saw nothing.
</p>

<p>
'Permit me to congratulate you, Sir
Ranald&mdash;' he began.
</p>

<p>
'On what?' asked the other, savagely.
</p>

<p>
'On the escape from death by drowning
which we were all led to suppose you and
Miss Cheyne had suffered.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't want your congratulations; and,
so far as Miss Cheyne is concerned, your
appearance in Antwerp sufficiently accounts
for her mysterious disappearance.'
</p>

<p>
Utter bewilderment, in which emotions
of dismay, fear, and anger coursed through
his mind, tied the tongue of Bevil
Goring&mdash;dismay and fear he knew not of what, and
anger lest this was some fresh trickery of
Lord Cadbury.
</p>

<p>
'Mysterious disappearance!' he faltered.
</p>

<p>
'Your conduct, Captain Goring, has been
shamefully deceitful&mdash;most dishonourable!'
exclaimed Sir Ranald, in a broken but still
enraged tone.
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'You came to my house at Chilcote a
welcome guest, then you stole the affections
of my daughter.  You have followed her
to Antwerp with plans best known to
yourself; and where&mdash;oh, where&mdash;is she now?'
</p>

<p>
'Sir Ranald!' expostulated Goring,
piteously, and feeling his face grow pale.
</p>

<p>
'Talk not to me!' resumed Sir Ranald,
in his tone of fury again; 'every silly girl
thinks she is in love, or that she must love
the first man who says he loves her.'
</p>

<p>
These strange utterances made Goring
half forget the errand on which he had
come, and utterly forget the fortuitous but
fortunate wealth which would, he hoped,
have made that errand perhaps successful.
</p>

<p>
'Vile trickster, you shall answer to me
for all the mischief you have wrought!'
exclaimed Sir Ranald, breaking the silence
that had ensued, though, if glances could
kill, Goring's earthly career had ended
there and then.  'We are in Belgium, and,
old as I am, I shall cover you with a pistol
at twelve paces, even if I should be propped
against a post&mdash;by heaven I shall!  Do you
hear me, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'You are very wrong, Sir Ranald, to
address me thus,' said Goring, gravely and
sadly; 'and, though you might level ten
pistols at me, God forbid that I should level
one at you&mdash;the father of her I have come
so far to seek, and, if I understand your
terrible words, apparently in vain.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't speak of my daughter, sir, and
don't attempt to humbug me!' thundered
Sir Ranald, almost beside himself with rage
and weakness.  'Bah!' he added, scornfully,
'to follow her here was pleasanter
and safer work than fighting the Ashantees.
Will you meet me at any time or place&mdash;we
may select to-morrow?'
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask?  To fight me.'
</p>

<p>
'Absurd&mdash;I shall not.'
</p>

<p>
'You will not?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Coward!'
</p>

<p>
'You are mad, Sir Ranald, to address
me, a tried soldier, thus injuriously,' said
Goring, more sadly than bitterly.  'I have
worn my Victoria Cross,' he added, striking
his breast, 'by no solitary act of rashness,
but by acknowledged proofs of disciplined
courage! and my name has an echo still on
the north-east frontier of India.'
</p>

<p>
'Coward!' hissed the old man's voice
again, as he looked round for some missile
to throw at the head of his visitor, who,
seeing it was useless to protract an interview
so painful and terrible, at once withdrew,
and the fierce, mocking laughter&mdash;and
strange laughter it was&mdash;of Sir Ranald
jarred sorely on his ear as he did so.
</p>

<p>
His head was in a whirl&mdash;what was to be
done?  The old man's anger and epithets he
pardoned; but from his utterances he gathered
that Alison was abducted or absent, and
that he was supposed to be the author of
the mystery that now filled him with terror
and anxiety.
</p>

<p>
When was she missed?  Had she been
decoyed from the hotel, or abducted in the
street, and how long since?
</p>

<p>
On these points the concierge, on having
a couple of five franc pieces deftly slipped
into his palm, soon enlightened him.
</p>

<p>
She had gone one night with Lord Cadbury
to the Théâtre des Variétés, and
milord had come home without her in great
terror and dismay, all search had proved
unavailing, even the ponds in the Park of
the Avenue Rubens had been dragged in
vain till the ice came.
</p>

<p>
'How long is it since she disappeared?'
</p>

<p>
'A week ago, monsieur.'
</p>

<p>
A mortal terror smote the heart of Goring
as he listened; but rage greatly took its
place when the concierge, with apparent
sympathy, referred to the dismay and
anxiety of Milord Cadbury.
</p>

<p>
This Goring deemed but trickery to cover
some act of deceit he had perpetrated, end
terribly did the as yet baffled lover resolve
to punish it; but he was rather surprised at
first by the manner in which he was suddenly
accosted by Cadbury, who now by chance
entered the vestibule of the hotel in which
several waiters were loitering, and, with all
an Englishman's genuine horror of a 'scene,'
made an effort to keep his temper.
</p>

<p>
As if following suit with Sir Ranald, the
peer, who now connected Alison's disappearance
with Goring's liberty, though the dates
did not tally, said to him haughtily, and in
in a low tone,
</p>

<p>
'So, Captain Goring, it seems to have
pleased you to follow my intended wife.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Your</i> intended wife!'
</p>

<p>
'Miss Cheyne of Essilmont, to this place&mdash;to
Antwerp, and that you have forced yourself
upon her as soon as you had the opportunity
of finding her alone.  By heavens,
you must have watched her steps closely.'
</p>

<p>
'Shuffler and juggler!' exclaimed Goring,
in his rage becoming as furious in his speech
as Sir Ranald.
</p>

<p>
'May I ask your reason for daring to
apply these epithets to me?' asked Cadbury,
reddening with passion to the tips of his
coarse, hairy ears.
</p>

<p>
'I shall give them to you on the
ramparts of the citadel, in the Champ de
Manœuvres, or anywhere else you choose.'
</p>

<p>
'Are you engaged in a melodrama, without
a musical accompaniment?' asked Cadbury, with a sneer.
</p>

<p>
'You will find it terribly real, I promise you.'
</p>

<p>
'Braggadocio!&mdash;behind the age.  Bah! people
don't fight duels now.'
</p>

<p>
'Cads and Cadburys, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Permit me to pass,' said the peer, assuming
what he thought an air of dignity that
only made his vulgar little figure look more
absurd.
</p>

<p>
'Not until I am fully answered,' replied
Goring, resolutely barring his way.
</p>

<p>
'Of your past intentions, Captain Goring, we&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Who are <i>we</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Sir Ranald and myself.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Of your past intentions we have an idea;
but what are your present?'
</p>

<p>
'To discover her, and carry her off,'
replied Goring, passionately.
</p>

<p>
'You know but too well where she is;
but I don't understand why you come
brawling in my hotel.  Concierge, get a
gendarme, and have this fellow expelled.'
</p>

<p>
'Will you meet me?' asked Goring, in a
low and concentrated voice.
</p>

<p>
'Most certainly not.  No man of honour
is obliged to go out with a man who has
been in the hands of the gendarmerie and
inside a prison.'
</p>

<p>
This recalled the story of the 'papers,'
and roused Goring's blood to boiling heat.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly, to the mingled amusement
and dismay of the concierge and group of
wondering waiters, made a brisk manual
application to the nose of my Lord
Cadbury, which he took between the first and
second fingers of his right hand, and
therewith administered such a wrench as made
the 'hereditary legislator' dance with rage
and pain.
</p>

<p>
'Now,' thought Goring, as he flung a card
at Cadbury's feet, and strode into the broad
and sunlit Place Verte, 'he must come out,
or the devil is in it!'
</p>

<p>
Little did either know how completely
they were all at <i>cross purposes</i>!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
THE CHALLENGE.
</h3>

<p>
Bevil Goring had latterly from various
sources heard much of Cadbury's
general character, which fully bore out the
opinions expressed of him by the two
<i>vauriens</i>, who were quite as unscrupulous&mdash;to
wit, Sir Jasper Dehorsey and Mr. Tom
Hawksleigh, and, like him, knew many of
'the soiled doves who flutter from tree to
tree in the forest of St. John, or build
their nests in Brompton Groves.'
</p>

<p>
'The union of January and May is so
common now-a-days,' says the author of
'Barren Honour,' 'that no one thinks of
inditing epithalamia thereon, satiric or
otherwise.'  But that Alison could be in any way
a party to the trickery of which the wealthy
Cadbury was quite capable, was not for a
moment to be imagined, as she idolised her
father, with all his defects of temper and
character, and would never leave him a
prey to doubt and anxiety, though at present
these emotions rather took the form of
parental indignation.  So what then was to
be thought?
</p>

<p>
Where could she be secluded, and under
what circumstances concealed from her father,
whose bearing, however offensive to Goring,
seemed genuine&mdash;the result of conviction?
As for Cadbury, Goring misdoubted him,
and believed him acting out a <i>rôle</i>, by which
he had imposed upon Sir Ranald.
</p>

<p>
He had not the shadow of a doubt of
Alison's strength of mind and purity of
purpose, yet pressure often achieved much.
Her father was evidently ignorant of her
whereabouts, and if Cadbury had her on
board his yacht, now anchored out in the
stream below the Tête de Flandres (which
was not impossible), <i>how</i> had she been taken
there, and by whom?
</p>

<p>
Had she been drugged, stupefied, or
what?  Such things are read of in the
public papers every day.
</p>

<p>
The position was well calculated to fill
the mind with perplexity and anxiety, anger
and indignation; and thus that of Bevil
Goring was a species of chaos!
</p>

<p>
If Goring actually had Alison with him,
why did he act the part he did&mdash;why come
before him at all? was the thought of Sir
Ranald, who missed her sweet presence and
gentle ministrations painfully and fearfully.
</p>

<p>
If Cadbury had her in enforced concealment,
what was his purpose in playing the
part he did to Sir Ranald? thought
Goring; anyhow, a bullet planted in the
well-fed person of the noble peer might
tend or lead to the revelation of all that,
and atone for Goring's recent detention in
the Rue des Beguines, so he thirsted almost
savagely for the hour of a hostile meeting
such as never could take place in the
England of the present day.
</p>

<p>
That Cadbury should utterly disbelieve
him was a matter of course, as it was a
point with that personage never to believe
sincerely in anyone, or that anyone ever
did a single thing without an interested
motive.  At home he was a man who was
arrogant among his equals, a tyrant among
his dependents and inferiors, and was the
terror of every poacher for thirty miles
round Cadbury Court.  So his reputation
was not a pleasant one.
</p>

<p>
In coming to Antwerp, Goring had learned
one great fact, that she was alive; that
she had not perished in the collision at sea;
but suppose that, from subsequent
circumstances, it were better that the waves
had closed over her? or suppose no trace
of her were ever to be discovered in any
way&mdash;that she had disappeared out of the
world, as it were?
</p>

<p>
Such things happen even in London;
so why not on the continent of Europe?
</p>

<p>
But he thrust these ideas aside as too
horrible for contemplation, and bent his
whole thoughts to the duel, which he never
doubted must come off now, and speedily,
after the terrible affront he had put upon
Cadbury, in presence of the Flemish
servants at the Hôtel St. Antoine.
</p>

<p>
If it took place, Alison's name, at all
hazards, must be kept out of the story,
which would be sure to find its way into
every 'Society' paper in London, and he
shrunk from the fear of her being made
the subject of hack gossip, which is ever
cynical or worse.
</p>

<p>
Goring waited all that day at the Hôtel
du Parc, expecting some messenger from
Lord Cadbury; and he waited a considerable
portion of the next; but none came;
so he bethought him of sending one on his
own account.
</p>

<p>
He had not a single friend in Antwerp;
but during those two days, while at
breakfast and other meals at the <i>table d'hôte</i> he
had sat next an officer of the Belgian
artillery, with whom&mdash;in the freemasonry
of soldiering&mdash;he speedily became intimate,
for all soldiers have a thousand interests,
sympathies, and topics in common.
</p>

<p>
Captain Victor Gabion was a handsome
fellow, about thirty years of age, with an
antique style of head and face, his cheeks
a clear olive tint, dark moustache, and keen
eye&mdash;handsome we say, but of a rare type;
a little effeminate, perhaps, but not the less
attractive for that.  He had a suavity and
sweetness of manner.  His form was well
knit; he was square-shouldered, singularly
slender in the waist&mdash;but that is affected by
all Belgian officers, and as a Captain of
Artillery when in undress wore a gold aiguilette
on the left shoulder, with cords across
the breast.
</p>

<p>
Full of his own thoughts and terrible
anxieties, Bevil Goring was not much in
a mood for talking about anything; but
the general <i>bonhomie</i> of Victor Gabion
was very attractive and infectious, and so
they rapidly became intimate; but we are
told that 'there are times when a man
must speak&mdash;even to a dog or his worst
enemy&mdash;rather than keep silence altogether.'
</p>

<p>
No message seemed likely to come from
Cadbury, so to kill time Goring had
accompanied his new friend to the artillery
quarters at the Caserne des Predicateurs, in
the street of the name, and so called from
being built, no doubt, on the site of an old
Dominican convent.
</p>

<p>
There is a strong family likeness in all
barracks, but to Goring's English eyes the
brick-floored rooms, the bare brick walls
looked strange; so did the batteries of
bronzed guns, drawn up wheel to wheel in
the square, the meagre onion soup conveyed
to the messes in buckets, and the slovenly
soldiers, in long-skirted, dark blue coats
with red worsted epaulettes, and buttons (<i>à
la</i> Childers) without numbers on them; and
ever and anon he felt a shiver when he
heard their trumpet calls&mdash;the calls with
which he had become so familiar during his
sojourn in the adjacent prison, in the Rue des
Beguines, only two hundred metres distant.
</p>

<p>
'And your regiment, monsieur,' asked
Gabion, 'where is it?'
</p>

<p>
'We have battalions in India, in Ireland,
and one is now, or shall soon be in Ashanti,'
replied Goring.
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;Sapristi! how I should like to serve
in distant lands and colonies!'
</p>

<p>
'Belgium must first get them,' thought
Goring.  And on returning to the hotel,
finding that there was still no message from
Cadbury, as his patience was utterly exhausted,
he confided in his new friend Gabion.
</p>

<p>
'I have had an unpleasant affair with a
countryman of mine, a Lord Cadbury, who
is now at the Hôtel St. Antoine; and as I
have no intimate friend in Antwerp,' said
he, 'will you as an officer&mdash;a brother
soldier&mdash;arrange for a meeting between us?'
</p>

<p>
The Belgian tugged his dark moustaches,
and hesitated, muttering, of course, the
inevitable
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sapristi!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'You understand?' said Goring.
</p>

<p>
'Perfectly; but, <i>mon ami</i>, I don't like
duels.  I was engaged in one once, and the
terrible memory of the part I had unwittingly
to play in it haunts me still.  What
is this quarrel about?'
</p>

<p>
'A lady&mdash;a lady whose name must at all
hazards be kept out of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Then no apology will suffice?'
</p>

<p>
'None.  And you will oblige me?'
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure,' replied the Belgian, as
he buckled on his sword, leisurely lit a
cigarette and crossed the open, sunny space
of the Place Verte, went to the hotel indicated
and sent up his card, which, in Belgian
fashion, was twice the size of an English
one, and bore his name in large letters,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  VICTOR GABION,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Capitaine d' Artillerie,</i><br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
with the letters E.L.V., signifying 'En la
Ville;' and after some delay he was ushered
into the room of Lord Cadbury, whom he
found in a rich <i>robe de chambre</i> tied with
silk cords, and wearing an elaborate
smoking-cap.  He laid his cigar on the stove,
near which he was standing, and tried to
eye his visitor superciliously, and to the
acute eyes of the latter his large feet, coarse
hands and ears, looked rather strange in an
English peer; but he inherited them with
the alderman's money, and they showed the
plebeian drop in his blood, as also did his
love for trinkets and personal adornment.
</p>

<p>
'You call yourself Captain Victor Gabion
of the Belgian Artillery,' said he, glancing
at the card, and tossing it beside his cigar.
</p>

<p>
'I am Captain Victor Gabion, of the Belgian
Artillery,' replied the officer, quietly.
</p>

<p>
'And what do you want with me?  I
have not the honour of your acquaintance,'
said Cadbury, having all the while a perfect
intuition of his visitor's purpose.
</p>

<p>
'I am here in the interest of Captain
Bevil Goring, of Her Britannic Majesty's
service, and monsieur must know with what
views.'
</p>

<p>
'Haven't the slightest idea,' yawned Cadbury,
yet nervously, as he resumed his cigar.
</p>

<p>
'Well, it is to arrange an hour and place
for a mutual meeting, with swords, or pistols
more probably.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, indeed.  Very kind and considerate
of you to take such interest in my affairs;
but I don't suppose, Captain&mdash;what's your
name?&mdash;oh, ah, Victor Gabion&mdash;that a peer
of the realm was, even of old, when such
things were in fashion, obliged to go out
with a commoner, nor am I with this fellow,
who, as you no doubt know, was but
recently in the hands of your authorities.
Moreover, people don't fight duels now.'
</p>

<p>
'In England, so I believe, but monsieur
is in Belgium.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n Belgium, I am not likely to forget that.'
</p>

<p>
'If monsieur adopts this tone to me, I
shall have the pleasure of a little turn with
him after.'
</p>

<p>
'After what?' asked Cadbury, with dilated eyes.
</p>

<p>
'After Captain Goring's affair is over.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil you will!' exclaimed the peer, greatly ruffled.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sapristi</i>&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
Pleasant this! thought Lord Cadbury;
two duels in prospect after all his schemes,
and 'no end' of money, and Alison slipped
through his fingers after all!
</p>

<p>
'Monsieur will refer me to a friend?'
said the Belgian, who waited quietly a little
time for him to speak, standing, too, for he
had never been offered a chair.
</p>

<p>
'A friend&mdash;for what purpose?' asked
Cadbury, savagely.
</p>

<p>
'To arrange with me for you and Captain Goring.'
</p>

<p>
Cadbury felt fairly cornered, and compelled
to affect a virtue which he did not possess.
</p>

<p>
'If monsieur has no friend in Antwerp,
one of my brother officers will, I have no
doubt, be happy to act for him.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, very much&mdash;what a considerate
lot you are, you Belgians!  Never mind
about a friend&mdash;I'll get one if I want
him&mdash;name your time and place.'
</p>

<p>
'Shall we say eight o'clock to-morrow
morning, at the citadel?'
</p>

<p>
'All right&mdash;I am your man!'
</p>

<p>
'In the Lunette St. Laurent, monsieur?'
</p>

<p>
'Very good.'
</p>

<p>
'Swords or pistols, monsieur?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, the devil&mdash;pistols, of course,'
replied Cadbury, as if he was in the habit
of fighting a duel every morning.
</p>

<p>
'Merci, monsieur, we shall not fail you,
and now good evening&mdash;bon soir.'
</p>

<p>
'Bon soir.'
</p>

<p>
The manner of Captain Gabion, who had
been eyeing him with some contempt,
twirling his moustache the while, changed
completely now, and, bowing with studious
politeness, he withdrew to report progress
to Bevil Goring.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br><br>
IN THE LUNETTE ST. LAURENT.
</h3>

<p>
At first a kind of&mdash;shall we say
it?&mdash;savage joy and exultation swelled up
in the breast of Goring at the prospect of
being face to face with Cadbury again, and
already in fancy he was covering with his
pistol the spectrum of the peer's thick-set,
pudgy person, for he had at first serious
doubts&mdash;though they were both on the
Continent&mdash;that the latter would accept his
challenge.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I have faced much in my short
time, and figured in many things; but I
never thought to do so in such an
old-fashioned affair as a duel!' he said, with a
grim smile, to his new friend Gabion.
</p>

<p>
And he wondered what Tony Dalton,
Jerry Wilmot, and others of the battalion
now far away beyond the equator, would
think of the event, when tidings would
reach them that he had been shot by Lord
Cadbury, or had shot the latter&mdash;and in a duel!
</p>

<p>
How strange it sounded to English ears now!
</p>

<p>
He wrote to his solicitors to settle a sum
stated&mdash;a handsome annuity on Alison, if
she was found&mdash;one that would keep her
every way independent alike of her father
and Lord Cadbury, if he fell by the hand
of the latter&mdash;instructions which made those
quiet and very acute legal practitioners,
Messrs. Taype, Shawrpe, and Scrawly, open
their eyes very wide indeed, when the
letter reached them at Gray's Inn Square.
</p>

<p>
His reveries were not very rose-coloured,
as he might be a dead man long before <i>this</i>
time to-morrow, he thought, while looking
at the clock; however, it did not impair his
appetite, and he and Victor Gabion spent
the evening at the Café Grisor, in the Rue
Von Shoonhoven, listening to the grand
organ which is played by machinery, while
enjoying their wine and cigars, far into the
small hours of the morning.
</p>

<p>
Yet we may be sure that there are few
men, if they told truth, but would acknowledge
that they felt a very unpleasant emotion
when thinking that when another round
of the clock was achieved their part in this
world might be over&mdash;ended and done
with!
</p>

<p>
In the morning he was in a brighter mood,
and, though infuriated against Cadbury, had
no desire to kill, but only to wound him, to
the end that he might wring from him the
secret of what he had done with Alison.  He
was a good marksman&mdash;had been a musketry
instructor&mdash;and with rifle and revolver
had done some great things among the
big game and hill tribes in India.
</p>

<p>
A revelation was all he wanted.  On his
own life, save in so far as Alison Cheyne
was concerned, he set little store.  How
short seemed the minutes he used to spend
with her under the old beeches at Chilcote,
or when in Laura Dalton's at the Grange.
Short and few, and how much alone he used
to feel when not with her!
</p>

<p>
Now how much more alone he felt, when
he seemed to have so mysteriously and
painfully lost her!
</p>

<p>
After some coffee, backed by a <i>chasse</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
dashed with cognac&mdash;he and Gabion&mdash;with
the latter's case of pistols&mdash;departed
before sunrise in a voiture for the citadel&mdash;a
pretty long drive, through winding and
tortuous streets, crossing between the great
shipping basins at the Quai Hambourg, and
ere long the houses were left behind, and
the great grassy embankments of the fortress
rose before them.
</p>

<p>
Every feature of the scenery, every detail
of what he saw, however petty and trivial,
impressed itself curiously upon the mind
of Bevil Goring on this eventful morning.
</p>

<p>
A group of old peasant women, with
wide dark-blue or black cloaks and
coal-scuttle bonnets, gossiping in the roadway;
children at cottage doors; Flemish labourers,
with hard and earnest types of face,
leisurely filling their huge pipes with
tobacco; a boy sitting on a gate, munching a
straw, and dreaming perhaps of the future;
the view of the vast Scheldt, curving in a
mighty sweep round the flat green Tête de
Flandres, with all its steamers and other
shipping.
</p>

<p>
The mighty cathedral spire, and all the
thousands of high-peaked roofs and masses
of the quaint city, thrown forward in dark
outline against the lurid and vapoury red
of the winter morning sky, all seen like a
vast panorama from the green heights of the
citadel.  Goring recalled the first morning
he had seen the latter from the deck of the
<i>Rotterdam</i>, and had looked at its great
gaping embrasures and lunettes, well flanked
out, with the leisurely interest it cannot fail
to have in a soldier's eye.
</p>

<p>
He was now perhaps looking upon Nature,
with all her beauties, for the last time, and
the coming spring and summer might be as
nought to him, even after the wealth that
had come upon him so unexpectedly; but
if he was fated to fall by Cadbury's pistol
his chief regret was not for these things, but
the fear that, unless those in another world
are cognisant of what passes in this, he would
never know the fate of Alison Cheyne, or
penetrate the veil that hid her whereabouts
in mystery now!
</p>

<p>
He listened somewhat as one in a dream to
Victor Gabion, who was drawing his attention,
with no small pride and enthusiasm, to
the features of the mighty model citadel,
which is now so deserted in aspect, and the
streets in the immediate vicinity of which
consist chiefly of the ruins of the arsenals
and magazines, that were destroyed in the
great siege of 1832, when only 4,500 Dutchmen,
under old General Chassé, defended
themselves with such desperation against
55,000 Frenchmen, under Marshal Gerard.
</p>

<p>
'My grandfather commanded a regiment
on that occasion,' said Gabion, 'and opened
the ball by attacking this part&mdash;the Lunette
St. Laurent, which lies nearest to the town.
The trenches were nine English miles long,
and sixty-three thousand shot and shell were
fired into the place before Chassé hauled
down his colours.  <i>Sapristi!</i> but that was
something like fighting!  <i>Diable!</i>' he added,
'we are not first on the ground.'
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring was much mortified to think
that in that matter he had been anticipated
by Lord Cadbury, when some dark figures
appeared hurrying towards them along the
<i>terre pleine</i> of the ramparts; but it was not
so, for those who approached proved to be
brother-officers of Gabion's, who, having
been informed by him of the affair, had
come forth, as one said, to see 'le sport.'
</p>

<p>
All touched their caps, and, after a few
passing remarks, looked round for the
appearance of Cadbury and his second, but
no one, save themselves, seemed to be in
the misty space, or amid the wet grassy
works of the citadel, and no voiture from
the town was as yet seen approaching the
entrance to it.  All these Belgian officers,
to Goring's eye, seemed very square-shouldered,
as they wore blue cloaks over their
gold epaulettes.  All were chatting and
laughing merrily, while smoking as if their
lives depended upon it.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sapristi!  Sacré Dieu!</i>' muttered Victor
Gabion, looking at his watch, 'ten minutes
past eight, and no appearance of milord.'
</p>

<p>
Time passed on.  The cathedral clock
struck half-past eight, and eventually nine;
but there was no appearance of Cadbury.
</p>

<p>
'Can he have fallen ill?' was the last of
many surmises as to this most unexpected
turn in the matter.
</p>

<p>
'Not likely; he would surely have had
the courtesy to send a message, and not
keep us loitering here,' said Captain Gabion.
</p>

<p>
The Belgians twirled their moustaches,
and exchanged glances of derision.
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring felt keen shame that any
Englishman should act as Cadbury had
done, and at last they all left the citadel
and drove back to the city.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Sapristi!</i>' was of course muttered by
everyone; 'what is to be done now?'
</p>

<p>
Goring thought, if he could meet his lordship,
he would certainly attack him rearward
with his foot, and, as Hudibras has it:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Because a kick in that place more<br>
  Hurts honour than deep wounds before.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At the very time that Goring and his
companions were cooling their heels on the
Lunette St. Laurent, the <i>Firefly</i> was
steering close-hauled against a head wind,
mid-way between the city and Flushing, with
Lord Cadbury on board!  Since coming there
he had imbibed in his wrath and tribulation
of spirit so many of Pemmican's brandies
and sodas that Tom Llanyard was puzzled
what to think, and his temper was horrible.
</p>

<p>
On the preceding afternoon, immediately
after the departure of Victor Gabion, he
had gone to the telegraph-office near the
Bourse, and telegraphed a message to <i>himself</i>
that he might confidently open it in the
presence of Sir Ranald Cheyne.  This he
accordingly did, and, saying nothing of his
recent visitor's purpose, he suddenly
announced that he must instantly depart for
London by steamer and train, but he hoped
that Sir Ranald, whom he left alone in his
misery, would telegraph to his club the
moment he heard tidings of Alison, on
which he, Lord Cadbury, would instantly
return to Antwerp.  And, after this, the
hereditary legislator (by one descent) took
his hurried departure.
</p>

<p>
Goring and his new friend Gabion, by
making inquiries, were not long in discovering
that he had sailed in his yacht.  Could
Alison, under any circumstances, be on
board that yacht too?
</p>

<p>
His departure so suddenly, if no puzzle
to Goring, was certainly one to Sir Ranald,
upon whose acceptance the peer pressed a
little cheque for any present necessities, and
he was just then sick of the whole affair.
</p>

<p>
Bevil Goring could go near Sir Ranald
no more, but, as he loitered near the hotel,
could he have looked in upon him just then
he would have forgiven him, and more than
forgiven him all, his passion and fury.
</p>

<p>
'A letter for you, Sir Cheyne,' the concierge
had said.
</p>

<p>
It was in a lady's hand, foreign in style,
and addressed to 'Sir Ranald Cheyne,
Hôtel St. Antoine, E.L.V.'  He opened it,
and read the contents in tremulous haste.
</p>

<p>
'Ailie&mdash;my own bird Ailie&mdash;it is about
her, but <i>what</i>?' he exclaimed, as his old
eyes filled with salt tears.  Then he
covered his face with his hands, and added,
hoarsely, 'Oh, my child, my darling Ailie!'
</p>

<p>
He strove to rise from his chair, but fell
faintly into the arms of the startled concierge.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
ON THE MARCH TO PRAH.
</h3>

<p>
And now, while Bevil Goring is
lingering somewhat hopelessly in Antwerp,
hearing nothing of Alison, and with all aim
apparently taken out of his life, feeling how
terrible is the unknown; and Laura Dalton
and Bella Chevenix are counting the days
of separation from those they love&mdash;the
long-lost husband in one case, the misjudged
lover in the other&mdash;the transport
with the Rifles on board, was running along
the western coast of Africa, and some
twenty days or so after the departure from
Southampton saw her, with the rest of the
sea and land armament, at anchor off the
Gold Coast.
</p>

<p>
Save in so far as it concerns the adventures
and fate of our friends Tony Dalton
and Jerry Wilmot, we do not intend to
write the story of how we fought there and
marched to Coomassie, or what was the
cause of the war, as there are never wanting
old soldiers to tell the true tale of the
fields in which they have fought.
</p>

<p>
Sir Richard Steele, that pleasing old
essayist, in one of his fugitive papers gives
us an amusing account of an ordinary in
Holborn, where a veteran captain, furnished
with a wooden leg, was never weary of
telling long stories about the battle of
Naseby, in which he had borne a part; and it
is always the result of every battle or
campaign of note to have survivors of it, who
become perhaps after-dinner bores.
</p>

<p>
Thus the veterans of Blenheim and
Malplacquet would hear with impatience the
terrors of the great Civil War, but inflicted
their reminiscences in turn on the victors of
Dettingen and Culloden.  So in turn the
heroes of the glorious Peninsula have now
given place to those of Alma and Inkerman,
and even their annals are fading now beside
those of the luckless and disastrous fields
of Southern Africa.
</p>

<p>
'The Army is full of men with stories in
their lives,' said Dalton to Jerry one day,
when talking of this very subject; 'but I
think, by Jove, that mine is an exceptionally
strange one.'
</p>

<p>
Jerry, on the other hand, was thinking it
strange that he should have proposed to his
friend's <i>wife</i>; but that fancy was all a thing
of the past now, and&mdash;when his genuine
love for Bella Chevenix was considered&mdash;seemed
a phantasy, an absurdity, out of
which the brilliant Laura had herself
laughed him, and he had ceased to think of her
before he ever thought hopefully of winning
Bella; but surely love in these days of
ours is not what it was a hundred years
ago, when, as the author of 'Guy Livingston'
has it, 'our very school-girls smile at
the love-conceits which beguiled their
grand-dames, even as <i>they</i> may have smiled at the
philandering of Arcadia.'
</p>

<p>
New Year's Day, 1874, was to witness the
landing of Sir Garnet Wolseley's expedition&mdash;army
it could not be called&mdash;on the Gold
Coast, consisting in all of about fifteen
hundred men, exclusive of officers.  The
Black Watch&mdash;clad in grey for the first
time since the regiment first mustered on
the Birks of Aberfeldy, a hundred and forty
years before&mdash;reckoned only nine hundred
bayonets, nominally, with the 23rd Welsh
Fusiliers and the Rifles, formed the infantry.
The pipers alone wore the kilt.
</p>

<p>
Long before daybreak, the Rifles came
ashore.  The seamen of the ships of war
and transports were supplied with lanterns,
in case the landing should occur in the
dark; but a brilliant moon, shining in a
clear, blue, cloudless sky, rendered their
use unnecessary, and the dark grey column,
with its black accoutrements and tropical
helmets, was soon massed on the beach, and
began its march alone under Colonel Arthur
Warren&mdash;a veteran of Alma and the Eastern
campaign&mdash;and long ere the sun of the
tropical noon was high overhead, had marched
seven miles on its route to the front; the
rest of the troops, with the Naval Brigade,
came on within five or six days, and the
advance was continued towards the Prah.
The troops did not&mdash;as the people at home
curiously expected&mdash;proceed towards that
now famous river by <i>railway</i>, as the
materials which were brought out for its
construction were not laid down, so 'that
wondrous jungle, with its foot-track, some
twenty or thirty inches wide, between close
walls of luxuriant greenery, swarming with
strange and lovely birds, hateful reptiles,
and monstrous insects, was not as yet to be
disturbed by the locomotives steaming and
screaming across the land.'
</p>

<p>
The troops marched without music.  The
pipes alone at times&mdash;playing the warlike
airs of other ages&mdash;woke the echoes of the
path to Coomassie, scaring the turkey
buzzards, the scavenger bird, and others of the
feathered tribes in the far recesses of the
dense primeval forests.
</p>

<p>
But there were some parts of the route
where it lay through still and lifeless dells
like those in the south of Scotland, without
shelter, and then the fierce sun of Africa
shone upon them with its pitiless glare, till
rifle-barrets and sword-blades grew hot to
the touch, and, like many others, Jerry
Wilmot and Dalton sighed as they thought of
iced champagne, of bitter beer 'in its native
pewter' (as Dickens has it), and the
fleshpots of Aldershot.
</p>

<p>
But anon, near Accrofal, the march lay
through groves of cotton-trees some two
hundred and fifty feet high, like the giant
vegetation of another world&mdash;trees with
stems like the Duke of York's column, as
Sir Garnet Wolseley afterwards said&mdash;shutting
out the sun from the wilderness of
bush below; and, as trees of other kinds
were already shedding leaves, the men often
marched more than ankle deep through
fallen foliage.
</p>

<p>
The desertion of five thousand Fantee
burden-bearers threw their task on the
troops, who&mdash;the 42nd setting the
example&mdash;carried the stores, in addition to their
kits, arms, and accoutrements, with seventy
rounds of ball cartridge, three ball-bags,
haversacks, belts, bayonet, and Snider-Enfield
rifle&mdash;terrible toil for white men in
such a climate.
</p>

<p>
At each halting-place food was cooked
by men in advance, and whenever a
half-battalion came in it was fed at once, and
the cooks went forward to the next.  Jerry's
man, O'Farrel, was 'invaluable as an
improviser of grub,' as Jerry said, though his
cuisine was somewhat inferior to the luxuries
of the transport mess.
</p>

<p>
The first halt on New Year's night was at
a place called Barraco, of which a party of
the Naval Brigade were the first to possess
themselves, and there they were as hearty
and happy as British sailors could be, as the
whole campaign in the bush seemed to them
but a spree ashore.  But they were chiefly
in their glory at night, when an enormous
camp fire was kindled by them&mdash;a fire upon
which the absolute and entire trunks of
trees were heaped&mdash;throwing its flames skyward
and its red light far into the recesses
and dingles of the untrodden forest.
</p>

<p>
So on New Year's night, in that strange
and isolated spot, were gathered the general
and his staff, the sailors and their officers,
and all made merry&mdash;the blue-jackets stepping
forth in succession to sing their best,
and often raciest, forecastle songs.
</p>

<p>
On the next day's march, the second of
January, the advanced guard raised a cheer.
</p>

<p>
'What's up?' asked Dalton&mdash;'the Ashantees
in sight?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' replied an officer, 'but the Prah
is&mdash;that famous river which they believe
no white man will ever be able to cross.'
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it was crossed that evening&mdash;the
first man who stemmed its current
being Lieutenant William Grant, of the 6th
Regiment.  It is sometimes called the
Boosemprah, or river of St. John.
</p>

<p>
Swift and muddy-coloured, here it was
rolling with great force between banks that
were almost perpendicular&mdash;it was seventy
yards wide and nine feet deep.  The foliage
on the banks was singularly beautiful, and
there the stupendous cotton-trees were
towering high in the air above a rich
undergrowth of palms and plantains.
</p>

<p>
The troops crossed it by a pontoon bridge,
and a trimly-hutted camp for three thousand
men was speedily formed by the engineers,
and then tents were pitched for Sir Garnet
and his staff.  Near them were parked the
artillery under Captain Rait.  It consisted
of two batteries of steel guns, rifled
muzzle-loaders, with one capable of throwing a
seven-pound shell, or an oblong twelve-pound
shell&mdash;sources of unutterable terror
to Ashantees.  There was also a multiplying
Gatling gun for musketry.
</p>

<p>
It was here that letters came from Koffee,
the barbarous Ashantee king, expressive of
a desire for peace, but not on such terms as
the general could grant after having come
so far; thus the advance on Coomassie, the
capital, was still resolved on.  The only
written language of the people is Arabic,
and the only persons who can write it are
Moors; but their verbal language is the
softest and most liquid on the Gold Coast,
abounding in vowels and nearly destitute
of aspirates.
</p>

<p>
The black and nearly nude ambassadors
remained in camp for a brief time, and one
of them, on seeing the practice of the
Gatling gun, which sent streams of bullets
in every direction to which its muzzle was
turned, told his colleagues that 'it was vain
to fight against foes so terribly armed.'
</p>

<p>
On this they taunted him with cowardice,
of which they threatened to inform King
Koffee, and, knowing what his doom would
be, the unfortunate creature shot himself,
and was buried on his own side of the river,
when each Ashantee, in accordance with
some ancient custom, threw a handful of
dust on his body and took their departure.
</p>

<p>
It was evident that there would soon be
fighting now.  'Sir Garnet's demands were
that the king must release all European
prisoners' (of whom he had several), 'pay
£200,000 for the cost of the war, and sign
in presence of our forces a treaty securing
firmly the British Protectorate from future
aggression.  Private warnings, however, and
the information gained by Lord Gifford and
Major Russel in their scouting advance
beyond the Prah, caused Sir Garnet to distrust
completely all the king's overtures for
peace.'
</p>

<p>
On the night after the dusky ambassadors
had departed, Tony Dalton had command
of an out-piquet in the direction of the
enemy, and as the sunset passed away he
had, as in duty bound, examined carefully
all the ground in his vicinity.
</p>

<p>
A night piquet, especially in a wood and
in a savage country, is always a post of danger.
By day sentries can see about them more or
less, but not so in the gloom of night, and
in a jungly wilderness where savages might
creep upon them unawares&mdash;even past or
between them&mdash;and cut the piquet off.
Hence no man thought of sleeping, and
Dalton had at least one connecting sentry
on the narrow track that led to the front
where his line was posted.
</p>

<p>
The pipers of the Black Watch, playing
tattoo in the hutted camp, had made the
mighty woods of the Prah re-echo to the
notes of the 'Pibroch of Donuil Dhu,' its
last notes had died away in the leafy dingles,
and as silence stole over the plain Dalton
gave way to thought.
</p>

<p>
The war in which he was engaged had
been stigmatised as one against savages, but
they were savages who were far from
being feeble foes; and if (as a print of the
time said) 'by honour and glory is meant
the creditable performance of duty at
the call of the State, then is that just
as applicable to soldiers and sailors who
fight savages as to those engaged in the
more showy scenes of European war.  Her
Majesty's troops do not pick and choose
either the enemies they have to encounter,
or the regions wherein their valour and
fortitude are to be displayed; and it is unjust
to shower laurels on one set of men, while
another, equally employed in defending our
empire, are deprived of due recognition.'
</p>

<p>
It was with a consciousness of this&mdash;the
high sense of duty&mdash;that our troops landed
cheerfully on the perilous Gold Coast; yet
Dalton, like many of his comrades, had been
elsewhere engaged in 'the big wars that
make ambition virtue,' and he felt that this
Ashanti strife, though a petty one, was
fraught with many dangers peculiar to itself.
Would he escape them, and yet be spared
to enjoy the society of the now brilliant and
beautiful Laura and their sweet little
daughter?  How hard if the bullet of a
naked savage deprived him of that double
joy, and gave him a grave amid the eternal
forest that spread from the Prah to
Coomassie!
</p>

<p>
He tried to shun this thought&mdash;that
almost <i>fear</i>, which came to his naturally
gallant spirit&mdash;but failed.  It <i>would</i> come
again and again, with a persistency that
troubled him; for life seemed dearer,
sweeter now, than it had ever been
before.  He never thought of sleep, but
indulged in waking dreams of scenes and
faces far away in pleasant Hampshire, and
in hopes that the wild work would soon be
over, and hideous Coomassie won.
</p>

<p>
The night wind was whispering among
rushes and reeds of wondrous growth, or
stirring the foliage of the cotton-trees,
between which could be seen the
stars&mdash;constellations unknown in our northern
hemisphere; and he could hear the ripple of the
Prah as it poured between its banks on its
way to St. Sebastian, the chirp of enormous
insects, the twitter of brilliantly plumaged
birds, scared by the red gleams of the
watch-fire.  Round the latter were the men of the
picket, in their grey Ashanti uniforms and
tropical helmets, in groups, sitting or lying
beside their piled rifles, the barrels of which
reflected the sheen of the flames.
</p>

<p>
As Dalton looked and listened, he felt as
one in a dream, amid surroundings so
strange, and far over the seas his heart
seemed to go, to where no doubt at that
hour little Netty, his daughter&mdash;<i>his daughter</i>,
how strangely it sounded!&mdash;was sleeping by
her mother's side 'like a callow cygnet in
its nest'&mdash;Netty so recently found, one of
whose existence he had been so long
ignorant.
</p>

<p>
The two tresses of hair he had got in
such hot haste at Southampton were many
a time drawn forth from the breast-pocket
of his Ashanti patrol-jacket, to be tenderly
unfolded, kissed, and replaced, for as yet
no locket had been procured in which to
enshrine them, and such an ornament was
not likely to be procured among the
reed-built wigwams of Coomassie.
</p>

<p>
Not far from him lay Jerry Wilmot,
indulging in thoughts of his own&mdash;wondering
on what terms were now Bella Chevenix
and haughty Lady Julia Wilmot, his cold
and heartless mother, who had seen him
depart from his father's house to face peril,
disease, toil, and, it might be, death, so
callously!
</p>

<p>
Adjacent to Dalton's post was many a
horrid souvenir of the hasty retreat made
across the Prah by the army of King Koffee,
by torchlight, on the night of the 29th of
the preceding November, when three
hundred men perished.  On the skirts of
our camp&mdash;the foreshore of the Prah&mdash;their
festering corpses lay in scores, and
many that were half skeletons hung
curiously and terribly from the branches of
trees that arched over the stream.  In one
place a dead Ashanti sat propped against
the stem of a palm-tree, with his head
between his hands and his elbows on his knees;
around him lay heaps of bones, among
which the turkey buzzards waddled.  All
these men had perished by having failed to
achieve a passage by the use of their rope
bridge.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the sound of musketry close by,
ringing out sharply upon the air of the
silent night, made the whole picket start
to their feet.
</p>

<p>
'Stand to!' cried Dalton, drawing his
sword.  'Unpile!' was the next order, and
the picket faced its line of sentries.
